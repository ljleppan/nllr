"We expect the same performance in net income over the next five years as we have had in the past," Ziering said.     Over the past five years Ziering said the company has had average compound net income growth of 32 pct annually with a 27 pct per year growth in earnings per share. For 1986 the company had net income of 6.3 mln dlrs, or 1.07 dlrs per share, vs 3.9 mln dlrs, or 73 cts per share in 1985.     Diagnostic manufactures medical immunological diagnostic test kits.     Ziering said he expects the earnings growth to result from positive effect of the weaker dollar on the company's exports sales as well as accelerated market penetration. Ziering said he expected the Food and Drug Administration to approve three more of its drug abuse test kits by the end of the year, which, depending on approval, should also help earnings growth.     Ziering said as a result of the new tax laws he expected the company's taxes to decrease by five pct to 31 pct of net income in 1987.      Reuter ;

TEST;11-MAR-1987 10:10:08.03;U.S. TRADE DEFICIT 38.37 BILLION DLRS IN 4TH QTR;  The U.S. merchandise trade deficit on a balance of payments basis was a record 38.37 billion dlrs in the October to December fourth quarter, the Commerce Department said.     The record trade shortfall came after a revised 37.15 billion dlr third quarter deficit. The department previously reported the third quarter deficit was 37.67 billion dlrs.     For the full year 1986, the merchandise trade deficit was a record 147.7 billion dlrs, up from 124.4 billion dlrs in 1985, the department said.     During the final quarter last year imports rose 2.78 billion dlrs or three pct to 95.7 billion dlrs, while exports rose 1.56 billion dlrs or three pct to 57.33 billion dlrs.     The trade report on a balance of payments basis excludes such factors as military sales and the costs of shipping and insurance.     The Commerce Department said non-petroleum imports in the quarter were up 2.7 billion dlrs or three pct to 87.7 billion dlrs, with the largest increases in consumer goods, which rose 1.2 billion dlrs, and in non-monetary gold and passenger cars from Canada, up 900 mln dlrs each.     Lumber imports from Canada fell 300 mln dlrs or 33 pct because of a 15 pct duty on imports from Canada, the department said. Passenger car imports fell 600 mln dlrs because of an 18 pct decrease in the number of South Korean-made imported cars and a nine pct decrease from Japan.     On the exports side, agricultural exports rose 600 mln dlrs or nine pct to 7.1 billion dlrs, primarily because of a 104 pct or 600 mln dlr increase in soybean exports.     Soybean shipments to Western Europe rose sharply because supplies from Brazil, a traditional major exporter, were limited by drought.     Commerce said the U.S. trade deficit with Latin America rose 900 mln dlrs to 2.6 billion dlrs, with Japan increased 700 mln dlrs to 14.8 billion dlrs and with Western Europe rose 200 mln to 7.2 billion dlrs in the quarter.     The deficit with newly industrialized Far East countries, including Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, fell 500 mln dlrs to eight billion dlrs and with Canada the deficit decreased 200 mln dlrs to 3.3 billion dlrs in the quarter.     In the full year 1986, imports rose 30.6 billion dlrs or nine pct to 369.5 billion dlrs. Exports increased by only 7.3 billion dlrs or three pct to 221.8 billion dlrs.     Commerce said petroleum imports during 1986 fell 16.6 billion dlrs or 33 pct to 33.9 billion dlrs because of lower prices. The average price per barrel decreased to 14.72 dlrs from 26.41 dlrs.     Agricultural exports fell by 2.6 billion dlrs or nine pct to 26.9 billion during the year. The average price of rice fell 27 pct, cotton was down 22 pct, corn 18 pct, wheat 16 pct and soybeans nine pct.     The trade deficit with Japan for all of 1986 rose 11.1 billion dlrs to 54.6 billion dlrs and with Western Europe increased 7.2 billion dlrs to 28.6 billion dlrs.  Reuter ;

Cut to Baa-2 from Baa-1 were the senior debt of the company and the guaranteed debt of its unit, Beneficial Overseas Finance NV.     Also downgraded were Beneficial's shelf registrations of senior debt to Provisional Baa-2 from Provisional Baa-1 and of subordinated debt to Provisional Ba-1 from Provisional Baa-3.     Moody's said the magnitude of Beneficial's 1986 operating losses from write-downs of discontinued businesses has weakened its financial position.     "The costs of meeting the potential liability for insurance losses to facilitate the sale of the company's insurance unit and of revaluing other discontinued business segments have substantially exceeded original indications," Moody's said in a release.     The agency said Beneficial's consumer finance business remains strong and has the capacity to withstand foreseeable adverse developments.     But the withdrawal from nontraditional businesses is weakening consolidated leverage, narrowing funding operations and depressing the quality of earnings, Moody's stressed.  Reuter ;
TEST;15-MAR-1987 06:19:34.96;TENSE TRADE TIES TO DOMINATE EC TALKS;  Tense trade relations with the U.S. And Japan and concern about the foreign impact of a proposed European Community (EC) tax on edible oils and fats are expected to dominate talks by EC foreign ministers here tomorrow.     EC diplomats said Britain demanded the early debate on the EC Executive Commission's proposal to impose a hefty tax on domestic and imported oils and fats in an attempt to head off a proposal it sees as extremely damaging to EC foreign relations.     The proposal was the most controversial part of a reform package, due to be discussed by EC farm ministers later this month, of the EC's Common Agricultural Policy -- widely seen as the root cause of the EC's persistent financial problems and of tensions with major trading partners.     The proposal is described by its promoters as a stabilisation program which would penalise a new sector going into massive overproduction and complement proposals to cut cereals and dairy production, rather than a straight forward tax.     They say it would not only curb the growth of oils and fats production and prevent imports from filling any vaccum left by a fall in EC output, but would also save the EC some two billion European Currency Units, over two billion dlrs, in farm costs.     It has provoked strong protests from domestic producers as well as foreign exporters, led by the United States.     The diplomats said the protests had been received from most corners of the developing and developed world, ranging from Senegal, Malaysia and Indonesia, to Brazil, Argentina, Canada, Iceland and Norway.     The proposal had little chance of approval by EC governments, with West Germany as strongly opposed to it as Britain, and Denmark, the Netherlands and Portugal also unconvinced of its political or economic wisdom.     Even Mediterranean countries such as Italy, France and Greece, which backed similar proposals in the past, did not seem as enthusiastic now because olive oil had been added to the list of products affected.     But the diplomats said a protectionist lobby in the U.S. And elsewhere was using the proposal as an excuse to promote anti-EC action, and the foreign ministers' debate should demonstrate the strength of feeling against the proposal within the EC and deprive its oponents of this argument.     The ministers were also due to discuss proposals in the U.S. Congress for a range of protecionist legislation such as a bill that would curb EC textile exports.     The diplomats said the ministers were expected to strongly back a Commission warning to Washington that such a bill, if enacted, would provoke swift EC retaliation.  REUTER ;

The officials will discuss linking rubber markets in the four countries to improve price transparency, the sources said.     This is the first time Indonesia is attending such a meeting, they said, but representatives from Thailand may not be able to attend because of their tight schedule. Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand account for 90 pct of world rubber exports and Singapore is a major regional rubber trading centre.     The Malaysian Rubber Futures market, freighting and contracts for rubber are among other issues expected to be discussed.     Last month, rubber importing and exporting countries adopted a new International Natural Rubber Agreement in Geneva. The new pact is more responsive to market trends than its predecessor, the sources said, and earlier provisions allowing the buffer stock to borrow from banks have been eliminated.  REUTER ;

TEST; 9-APR-1987 12:55:32.09;LOWER U.S. FARM PAYMENT BASE EYED FOR SAVINGS;  Reducing the amount of crop base a farmer can receive deficiency payments on is being looked at as one way to cut the U.S. agriculture budget for fiscal year 1988, congressional aides and lobbyists said.     Rep. Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.) has suggested that the planted crop base a producer receives deficiency payments on be reduced by five pct, an aide to Stenholm said.     The aide said no official proposal has yet been drawn up, but that as it becomes more clear exactly how much agriculture spending will have to reduced, specific numbers will be discussed and a proposal could "very likely" be drafted.     Under the proposal, if a farmer idled 20 pct of his acreage base and was eligible to plant the remaining 80 pct, he would receive payments on only 75 pct of his total base.     Current regulations provide farmers with deficiency payments on 100 pct of their non-idled acreage.     Reducing the payment base by five pct could save around 400 to 500 mln dlrs, but would have to be applied to the 1987 crop programs in order for any savings to accrue in fiscal year 1988, an Agriculture Department economist said.     Stenholm's aide said when the proposal is officially offered, it would likely be an amendment to the budget reconciliation bill.     Other options currently being talked about as a way to cut one to two billion dlrs from the farm budget include increasing acreage reduction programs, limiting farm payments, implementing a 0/92 acreage set-aside program or limiting the use of generic in-kind certificates.

TEST; 3-MAR-1987 18:07:32.91;SOUTH AFRICA CORN EXPORTS COULD BE REDUCED-USDA;  Despite earlier optimistic indications, the South African corn crop is at a critical stage in its development and recent reports of heat stress could reduce production and therefore exportable supplies, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the department said South Africa's corn exports in the 1986/87 (Oct-Sept) season are estimated at 2.5 mln tonnes, up 40 pct from the previous year.     The re-emergence of South Africa as a competitor follows a period of severe droughts, which at one point required South Africa to import 2.7 mln tones of U.S. corn in 1983/84, it said.     Since those imports in 1983/84, the U.S. has been facing increased competition from South Africa in Taiwan and Japan.     But if South Africa is perceived as lacking available supplies, purchases of U.S. corn may be further stimulated, the department said.  Reuter ;

TEST;25-MAR-1987 06:51:56.93;MIXED ASIAN REACTION TO NEW RUBBER PACT;     By Rajan Moses, Reuters Governments of major Asian producing countries have welcomed the conclusion of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA), but growers and traders are unhappy with the development, according to views polled by Reuter correspondents.     Officials in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, which produce the bulk of the world's rubber, said they expected the new pact to continue to stabilise prices and help their rubber industries remain viable in the long-term.     But traders and growers said they were against the new pact because its buffer stock mechanism was likely to interefere with free market forces and prevent sharp rubber price rises.     The new INRA, to replace the current one which expires on October 22, was formally adopted by most of the world's producers and consumers in Geneva last Friday.     It will be open for signature at the U.N. Headquarters in New York from May 1 to December 31 this year and will enter into force provisionally when ratified by countries accounting for 75 pct of world rubber exports and 75 pct of world imports.     Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik said the formal adoption of a new pact had dispelled fears of liquidation of some 360,000 tonnes of INRA buffer stock rubber and a possible depression of prices.     He expressed confidence that the new INRA would continue to keep prices stable by selling or buying rubber as prices rose or fell through its buffer stock system.     Malaysia was also happy that in the new INRA financing of purchases for the normal buffer stock of 400,000 tonnes and a contingency buffer stock of 150,000 tonnes would be done through direct cash contributions from members, he said.     Under the existing pact, members can borrow from banks to finance INRA's buffer stock purchases. This has been viewed with concern by some members who fear the INRA may become indebted and ultimately face collapse, like the International Tin Agreement.     "This will ensure the buffer stock operation is carried out without any financial encumbrance," Lim said.      Malaysia, the world's largest producer, was seeking cabinet approval to join the new INRA and hoped other producers and consumers would also become members, he said.     Officials in Jakarta said the new pact would bring benefit to Indonesia's rubber industry's by stabilising prices.     It was unlikely to collapse like the tin agreement because its new financial provisions had been tightened, they said.     Thai officials told Reuters they were optimistic the new pact was viable because it strictly limited the extent of debt the INRA buffer stock manager might commit to his market operations.      Malaysian growers, however, said they preferred a free rubber market because an INRA had a tendency to keep prices at levels that were only acceptable to consumers.     "With the INRA's ability to keep prices at a certain stable level, consumers are assured of rubber at almost a fixed price, while producers may never see sharp price rises," a Malaysian Rubber Producers Council source told Reuters.     Producers also wanted a free rubber market without the overhang of a 360,000 tonne INRA buffer stock which had psychologically prevented price rises, he said.     State plantation officials in Sri Lanka said prices had been depressed since INRA's inception and the creation of a buffer stock, and they seemed unlikely to rise.     Sri Lanka should not be a member of the INRA because it was expensive to maintain a buffer stock, they added.     Traders in the region, meanwhile, said prices might be pressured by the new pact in the long term as its potential to stabilise prices and buffer stock capacity would spur producers to produce more.     Most Malaysian and Singapore traders said the new pact's conclusion had little impact on prices and it was unlikely to allow sharp price fluctuations in future.     "The 360,000 tonnes in the INRA buffer stock must be liquidated and a free market returned," a Malaysian trader said.     Japanese traders said the new pact had a chance for success as most world producers and consumers had adopted it, but they questioned the ability of some financially-strapped producers to finance buffer stock operations.

TEST;26-MAR-1987 08:12:55.80;PHILIPPINE DEBT TALKS PROCEED WITH NARROWER FOCUS;  The latest round of talks between Philippine officials and the country's commercial bank creditors on the rescheduling of 9.4 billion dlrs worth of debt are still proceeding, but with a narrower focus, Philippine Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin said.     He told a press briefing Wednesday that Manila has dropped a two-tier interest payment offer, which would have given banks a higher return if they took partial payment in new Philippine investment notes (PINs) instead of in cash.     "The PINs proposal has been laid aside.... The discussion is now on pricing (of just the cash payments)," he said.     Foreign banking sources in Manila said on Tuesday that the Philippines had raised its basic interest rate offer to 7/8 over the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) but Ongpin would not discuss details of the pricing negotiations.     He also refused to speculate on when an overall agreement might be reached. The talks have been going on for more than three weeks.     Manila originally offered to pay interest in cash at 5/8 over LIBOR or in a mixture of cash and PINs -- tradeable, dollar-denominated, zero coupon notes that could potentially yield up to one point over LIBOR.     The PINs option was subsequently modified to guarantee at least a 7/8 point spread over LIBOR but many bankers still had grave reservations, seeing it as a possible precedent for other large debtors to avoid paying interest in cash.     The PINs proposal has now been left on the table as a separate option for those banks, which might want to fund their own investments in the Philippines or sell the notes in the secondary market, Ongpin said.     Under Manila's plan, the PINs would be redeemable at full face value in Philippine pesos to fund local equity investments at any time prior to their six-year maturity date.     While the commercial banks had their doubts about the PINs proposal, Ongpin said there was great interest on the part of certain investment banks which are already active in the secondary market for sovereign debt.     Unlike current debt/equity schemes, Ongpin said, the PINs would include no government fees and would be free from "administrative hassles."     He said about six investment banks had been approached and four had replied so far. One even showed interest in buying 45 mln dlrs worth of notes, he said.     Ongpin said that by funding current interest payments in the secondary market through the PINs scheme, the Philippines could conserve at least one to 1.5 billion dlrs of foreign exchange reserves during its planned seven-year restructuring period.

"The business of granting loans to Poland is not as bad a business as you might imagine," senior Polish government spokesman Jerzy Urban told a news conference in Stockholm.     Urban, visiting the Swedish capital to deliver a lecture at the Foreign Policy Institute, announced earlier this week that Poland would soon offer shares to private citizens in state companies in a bid to make the economy more responsive.     This was part of a major economic reform to be announced in the coming weeks, he said.     Urban said the main problem with his country's foreign debt burden of 32 billion dollars was short term interest charges but  the long term looked more secure.     He said he hoped talks under way with the Paris Club, grouping Poland's main government creditors, would shortly solve the problem of short term servicing.     Urban told reporters that debt servicing was hampering the expansion of the national economy, but that the new plans for economic reform would "open new vistas for Polish exports."     He criticised the blocking efforts of some Western governments, whom he declined to name, for putting political considerations ahead of economic co-operation.

A MITI spokesman said his ministry had asked chipmakers to issue certificates to specified trading houses stating they are authorised exporters.     Trading houses applying for a MITI export licence will be required to show such a certificate, but those without it will not automatically be denied licences, he said.     But some industry officials predicted any government measures were likely to have limited effect as long as the world semiconductor market remained weak.     U.S. Government and industry officials have complained repeatedly that Japanese chipmakers continue to sell at below cost to third countries despite the July agreement.     Japanese firms and officials in turn argue the flow of cheap chips to third countries is due to grey-market sales by third-party brokers, who seek to profit from the gap between low prices in Japan and higher prices based on production costs and set for Japanese makers under the agreement.     The MITI spokesman said, "If the percentage of grey market is increasing for one specific company, it suggests they are distributing their products through their sales network knowing they will be exported by some means. In that case we will ask them what they are doing to reduce the figure."     MITI earlier asked makers to cut output of certain chips by 10 pct in first-quarter 1987, spokesmen for the firms said.     But they doubt the usefulness of the latest move. "As long as there is a gap between prices set under the pact and market prices, there will be people who want to exploit the gap to make money," a Hitachi Ltd <HIT.T> spokesman said.  REUTER ;

TEST; 3-MAR-1987 08:35:15.78;U.S. LEADING INDEX FELL 1.0 PCT IN JANUARY;  The U.S. index of leading indicators fell a seasonally adjusted 1.0 pct in January after a revised 2.3 pct December gain, the Commerce Department said.     The department previously said the index rose 2.1 pct in December.     The decline in January was the biggest for any month since July, 1984, when the index fell 1.7 pct.     The January decrease left the index at 183.8 over its 1967 base of 100, and was led by a fall in contracts and orders for plant and equipment.     A total of six of 10 indicators available for January contributed to the decline.     Besides contracts and orders for plant and equipment, they were building permits, manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods, a change in sensitive materials prices, slower deliveries from vendors and higher average weekly claims for state unemployment insurance.     Four of 10 indicators were positive, including stock prices, new business formation, average work week and money supply.     The main factor for the December upward revision was new business formation.     There was no revision in the 0.9 pct increase in the leading indicators index for November.     The index of coincident indicators, which measures the current economy, fell 0.1 pct in January after increases of 0.7 pct in December and 0.2 pct in November.     The index of lagging indicators, which measures past economic activity, rose 0.5 pct in January after a decrease of 0.5 pct in December and an increase of 0.2 pct in November.  Reuter ;

TEST; 3-MAR-1987 13:15:51.58;U.K. EXPORTS BODY GETS NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR;  Export Credits Guarantee Department has named Malcolm Stephens, director of export finance at Barclay's Bank Plc and a former career civil servant at ECGD for 17 years, to the post of executive director, a department spokesman said.     Stephens replaces Jack Gill, who is retiring early aged 57.     A drop in the ECGD's business volume and a rise in its debt to the Exchequer have led to criticism in Parliament in recent years.     Stephens said the fall in business volume was a top convern, adding that the department may have to compete more aggressively with private insurance firms providing similar services.     The department's annual report for the year ended March 31, 1986, showed exports insured by the department fell to 15.7 billion stg from 17.4 billion the year before, while its debt to the Exchequer almost doubled to 756 mln stg.     Stephens said he had no specific list of changes. But among his chief concerns was the weakened condition of lesser developed countries and their ability to pay for their imports.     The agency will have to review its policies on insuring export credits to lesser credits on a country by country basis, he said. "Large lump political risk insurance is the sort of thing we want to take a look at."     "You have to try to look forward to see if you are simply in a peak and trough situation or it is a more long term thing," Stephens said, in response to a qustion about whether ECGD will strike more countries from its list of political risk insurance recipients.     He noted that certain countries have already been removed from the list.  REUTER ;

The bill, which the committee is scheduled to consider tomorrow, would prohibit non-bank banks from beginning any new activities after March 5, increase the number of their locations or cross-market products or services not permissible for bank holding companies.     The bill would also impose a one-year moratorium on bank securities or insurance activities.     The bill would establish a financing corporation to raise 7.5 billion dlrs for the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp and give federal regulators more power to arrange out-of-state mergers for failed or failing banks with 500 mln dlrs or more in assets.     Committee chairman William Proxmire, D-Wis, had wanted to ban all non-bank bank activities started after July 1, 1983, but opposition from other committee members forced him to revise the legislation.     The House Banking committee is also considering bank regulation legislation, but is waiting for the Senate to act.      Reuter ;

TEST; 5-MAR-1987 10:58:42.27;SHAD SEES PROGRESS ON INSIDER TRADING;  Securities and Exchange Commission chairman John Shad said progress was being made in stopping insider trading, but the chairman of a House subcommittee with jurisdiction over securities laws said he was concerned about conditions on Wall Street.     "Greed has created a feeding frenzy on Wall Street and in the process laws are broken and multi-billion dlr corporations have become easy prey," Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass, the chairman of the Telecommunications and Finance said at the start of a hearing on SEC activities.     "Congress is understandably nervous. We perceive the current scandals as a warning of even worse things to come," Markey said. "The frenzy and disruption created by merger mania is particularly distressing."     Shad said the recent cases involving Ivan Boesky, Dennis Levine and others was a warning that those who engage in insider trading were taking a heavy risk of imprisonment, high fines and disbarment from the securities industry.     "Insider trading has not been eradicated, but it has been inhibited and multimillions of dollars of profits that Boesky and others have been siphoning off the markets are now flowing through to legitimate investors and traders," Shad said in his statement.     Shad said insider trading cases involved only 10 pct or less of SEC enforcement actions in recent years but they have increased significantly to 125 cases brought during the past five years compared to 77 cases in the preceeding 47 years.     Markey said he did not favor banning takeovers but thought the tender offer process needed reform including earlier disclosure of takeover attempts.     N.J. Rep. Mathew Rinaldo, the senior subcommittee Republican, said he was introducing legislation to create a five member commission to study the securities industry for a year and report its findings and recommendations to Congress. Commission members would be appointed by the SEC.     "Its primary mission would be to analyze the extent of illegal trading on insider trading and to assess the adequacy of existing surveillance systems and government oversight operations. The commission would advise Congress as to what additional resources or civil or criminal remedies are needed to combat fraud and improve compliance with federal laws," Rinaldo said.  Reuter ;

"Within the next few weeks, we expect to propose a program that will provide equitable, no-fault compensation to injured persons, and predictable (and hence insurable) liabilities for vaccine manufacturers," Dennis Ross, tax legislative counsel for treasury, said in prepared testimony.     The Vaccine Act was signed into law last year but did not include a funding mechanism for its compensation program.     Ross noted 50 to 75 children a year suffer serious long-term or injuries from adverse reactions to vaccine for diptheria, tetanus and whooping cough alone.     But he said lawsuits were causing drug companies like Wyeth Laboratories and Parke, Davis and Co to stop producing childhood vaccines.     The administration would not favor funding compensation through an excise tax levied on the vaccine producers because it would add to collection and auditing burdens, Ross said.     He did not suggest a favored funding mechanism but said a lump-sum trust fund for compensation might be preferable.  Reuter ;

Late last month de Graaf said that if the dispute was not settled by Monday this week he would withdraw the subsidy.     The chairman of the port employers' organization, SVZ, Jacques Schoufour, said he was unhappy with the decision and added there was now no alternative to proceeding with redundancy plans.     The series of strikes in the sector started on January 19 in protest at employers' plans to make 800 redundancies from the 4,000-strong workforce by 1990 starting with 350 this year.     Meanwhile, the port and transport union, FNV, attacked loss figures given for the port for this year.     The figures, issued by accountants on behalf of the SVZ, put total losses for last year at 34 mln guilders and in 1985 at 37 mln. Earlier, the employers had put the figure at around 30 mln.     The FNV said the actual losses were nearer 17 to 20 mln and said the employers had inflated the figures as part of their plan to restructure completely the port's general cargo sector.  Reuter ;

TEST;11-MAR-1987 09:11:07.62;OPEC REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO FIXED PRICES, CEILING;     By James Jukwey, Reuters OPEC has reaffirmed its commitment to fixed crude oil prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel and an overall output ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) to defend prices, its president Rilwanu Lukman said.     He told a news conference here "After due consultation with my colleagues in OPEC, I hereby wish to emphasize that Nigeria and all member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas and official selling prices."     Lukman added no extraordinary OPEC conference was planned.     "We are in a position to re-confirm that, despite misleading news in foreign media to the contrary, ... OPEC member countries as a whole produced below their agreed quota in the month of February," Lukman, who is Nigerian oil minister, said.     Lukman put the overall OPEC output shortfall in February at 900,000 bpd and said this was as a result of their firm determination to defend official selling prices of 18 dlrs agreed upon last December in Geneva.     The December agreement set an overall output ceiling for OPEC of 15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 and restored fixed prices as from February 1 around a reference point of 18 dlrs.     Oil prices rallied immediately after the Geneva accord but fell again last month on reports that OPEC was producing more than the agreed level.     "The idea was to suggest that OPEC's agreement would not hold and this caused some customers to hold back purchases of OPEC oil and resort to destocking to meet their needs," Lukman said.     He said the 900,000 bpd shortfall last February was based on the verified figure for 10 out of OPEC's 13 members, adding that Nigeria alone had a shortfall in production of 100,000 bpd.     Iraq disassociated itself from the December agreement, while the production figures of Ecuador and the United Arab Emirates needed to be verified, Lukman said.     "If that is the price we have to pay to make the agreement succeed, we are ready ... OPEC is not changing its price level of 18 dlrs," the group's president said.     He said the OPEC price differentials committee meeting formerly postponed to April had been put off indefinitely.     "Furthermore, no extraordinary meeting of the conference is at the moment contemplated since most agreements reached in December are being adhered to," he said.     Asked if the committee did not need to meet soon to narrow the gaps in the prices of the various OPEC crudes -- fixed in relation to the 18 dlr benchmark -- Lukman replied "We consider the defence of our prices much more crucial than differentials."     Lukman said OPEC was aware that consumers had heavily drawn on stocks of both crude oil and refined products to levels well below this time last year and soon they would return to the market in search of crude.     "We don't see that there is going to be any difficulty in maintaining the 18 dlr price throughout the rest of the year," Lukman said.     The OPEC president praised non-OPEC oil producers, which he said had contributed to the group's efforts to stabilise prices, but he criticised Britain for maintaining its long-held view not to do anything to help the market.     "We are quite confident, however, that in the long-term with two-thirds of the world's reserves in OPEC hands, the future is ours. We will use that advantage responsibly," he said.     Lukman described the disruption in Ecuador's output following an earthquake as tragic, but refused to say if the South American country would be allowed a higher output quota when it recovered from the disaster.

February bankruptcies fell 14.9 pct from a year earlier, the 26th straight monthly decline, and debts fell 54.3 pct.     The lower number of bankruptcies in February reflected a relaxation of money market conditions and reduced bill settlements due to fewer operating days, it said.     Bankruptcies caused by the strength of the yen against the dollar totalled 69, or 6.4 pct of those in February, with debts of 25.52 billion yen, the research firm said.     This compared with 64 with debts of 125.59 billion yen in January, it said.     Currency-linked bankruptcies since November 1985, when the dollar's depreciation against the yen began to affect Japanese export-linked firms, totalled 772, with cumulative debts of 660.53 billion yen, it said.     The value of the yen against the dollar rose to an average 153.49 yen per dollar in February from 184.62 a year earlier.     Bankruptcies usually decline in the first quarter of the year due to fewer operating days and for seasonal reasons.     Bankruptcies are expected to increase in the quarter starting April 1 due to expectations of slow consumer spending, low wage increases for the 1987/88 fiscal year which starts in April, and slow capital spending by manufacturers, the company said.     Bankrupcties among export-linked subcontractors will rise due to a recent shift by major manufacturers to overseas production, it added.  REUTER ;

TEST;12-MAR-1987 10:04:29.48;K MART <KM> SAYS RECORD 1986 NET "TURNING POINT";  K Mart Corp said its record fiscal 1986 net earnings of 582.3 mln dlrs, a rise from 221.2 mln dlrs a year ago, marked a "major turning point" for the world's second biggest retailer.     K Mart said the earnings rise for the fourth quarter ended January 28 to 285 mln dlrs from 10.5 mln dlrs resulted from  "merchandising, refurbishing and expense control."     A year ago, K Mart took a charge of 239 mln dlrs for discontinued operations. Earnings from continuing retail operations in the quarter totalled 270 mln dlrs or 2.00 dlrs a share compared with 249.4 mln dlrs or 1.91 dlrs a year ago.     K Mart Chairman Bernard Fauber said "the success of these programs is better illustrated by the strong 35.9 pct increase in 1986 income from continuing operations before income taxes to 1.03 billion dlrs, the first time K Mart Corp has reached this milestone."     Sales for the 1986 fiscal year reached a record 23.8 billion dlrs, an 8.1 pct rise from 22.04 billion dlrs the prior year. K Mart said 1985 was restated to account for discontinued operations. Comparable store sales rose 5.5 pct in 1986 over 1985, it said.     Fauber said the sales growth came from greater consumer acceptance of K Mart's apparel merchandise, "a marked increase in hardline merchandise sales and a growing contribution from specialty retailing operations."     K Mart said its fourth quarter pre-tax income from continuing operations was 493 mln dlrs, a 32.3 pct gain from 372.6 mln dlrs last year. It said sales in the period grew 8.8 pct to 7.23 billion dlrs from a restated 6.65 billion dlrs in 1985 with comparable store sales up 4.7 pct.     K Mart said its effective tax rate rose in 1986 to 44.6 pct from 37.6 pct in 1985. But it said selling, general and administrative expense eased to 23.2 pct of sales from 23.7 pct in 1985.     "Our performance in 1986 marks a major turning point for K Mart," Fauber said in a statement.     "In the years immediately prior to 1986, we focused on changing the look of our stores and the structure of the company."     K Mart, he said, committed billion of dollars for store remodeling and installing a centralized point of sale system, upgraded its merchandise mix, acquired three large specialty retailers, divested underperforming businesses and restructured its long-term debt.     "We were forced to pay a temporary price in the form of slower earnings growth and a lower rating by the investment community. However, beginning with the fourth quarter of 1985, our improved performance is proof that our approach is correct for the long term," the K Mart chairman said.  Reuter ;

TEST;13-MAR-1987 12:09:17.25;SALOMON INC <SB> SAID TO CUT U.S. BANKS RATINGS;  Salomon Inc has lowered its investment ratings on all U.S. money center banks, institutional sources said.     The sources said Salomon believes that other money center banks may feel compelled to follow Citicorp's <CCI> lead in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to its loan exposure to Brazil.     They also said Salomon believes that other banks may strongly consider the possibility of placing Brazilian loans on a non-accruing status with the consequent negative impact on earnings.     The sources said the ratings were lowered to M from O-plus. The stock are now expected to match the Standard and Poor's 500 Index, rather than outperform the index as previously expected.     The sources said it is also understood that the change in the coding of these stocks should definitely not be taken as a sell-recommendation because Salomon is said to believe that its downgrading will only prove temporary.     The banks affected by the change in investment coding are Bank of New York Co Inc <BK>, Bankers Trust Co <BT>, Chase Manhattan Corp <CMB>, Chemical New York Corp <CHL>, Citicorp <CCI>, Irving Bank Corp <V>, Manufacturers Hanover Corp <MHC>, J.P. Morgan and Co Inc <JPM>, Marine Midland Banks Inc <MM>, Republic New York Corp <RNB>, Bank of Boston Corp <BKB> and First Chicago Corp <FNB>.     The institutional sources said that Thomas Hanley, a director of Salomon Inc subsidiary Salomon Brothers who is in charge of bank stock research, believes Citicorp's move is well-timed.     Should Citicorp actually place the Brazilian loans in a non-performing category at the end of this quarter this action would serve to alleviate the urgency associated with the debt negotiations, he argues.     Thus Citicorp's bargaining position would appear to have been much enhanced.  Reuter ;

The agency said in its annual statement that it had assets with a total book value of 25 billion dlrs, or a market value of 28 billion dlrs, at the end of 1986.     These holdings had a rate of return of 13.5 pct in the year, which was below the Caisse's average return of 16 pct in the past four years and 14.2 pct in the past eight years.     The Caisse said foreign equity investments represented 3.6 pct of total assets, while U.S. government securities accounted for another 5.2 pct of the overall portfolio.     The agency's holding of U.S. government securities yielded a return of 20.7 pct for the year, significantly more than either the 14.1 pct earned on the total bond portfolio or the 13.5 pct for all funds under management.     "These high liquidity securities, which are held on a temporary basis and for purposes of strategy and the protection of the overall bond portfolio, have been efficient," the agency said of the U.S. securities.     The agency said it has 7.9 billion dlrs invested in Canadian private sector businesses after channeling 965 mln dlrs of new funds into this area in 1986.

TEST;19-MAR-1987 21:36:32.84;BELGRADE UNIONS ATTACK YUGOSLAV PAY FREEZE;  Belgrade trade union leaders have joined attacks on a controversial wage freeze in Yugoslavia and reported strikes spreading to the capital.     Miodrag Lazarevic, president of the Belgrade trade unions council, said the government must take responsibility for the effects of the law imposing the wage freeze.     Under the law, which was enacted on February 27 and will remain in force until July 1, wage levels of the last quarter of 1986 were reimposed and future pay rises were pegged to productivity. The move has caused resentment and widespread industrial unrest throughout the country.     Another Belgrade trade union council leader, Predrag Petrovic, was quoted as saying hundreds of workers had been on strike in Belgrade.     Yugoslav trade unions are an integral part of the communist political system and their role has traditionally not been to defend workers from the government. The criticisms by the Belgrade union leaders indicated wider trade union resentment of the law than earlier reported.     The government has officially reported 70 strikes throughout the country, although Yugoslav newspapers have indicated there have been more.  REUTER ;

TEST;20-MAR-1987 17:00:29.12;U.S. SUGAR PROGRAM CUT SENT TO CONGRESS BY USDA;  The U.S. Agriculture Department  formally transmitted to Congress a long-awaited proposal to drastically slash the sugar loan rate and compensate growers for the cut with targeted income payments.     In a letter to the Congressional leadership accompanying the "Sugar Program Improvements Act of 1987", Peter Myers, Deputy Agriculture Secretary, said the Reagan administration wants the sugar loan rate cut to 12 cents per pound beginning with the 1987 crop, down from 18 cts now.     Sugarcane and beet growers would be compensated by the government for the price support cut with targeted income payments over the four years 1988 to 1991. The payments would cost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs, Myers said.     The administration sugar proposal is expected to be introduced in the House of Representatives next week by Rep. John Porter, R-Ill.     Congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic it is unlikely to be adopted in either the House or Senate because politically-influential sugar and corn growers and high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist.     The direct payment plan outlined by the administration  targets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and gradually lowers payments over four years. It also excludes from payment any output exceeding 20,000 short tons raw sugar per grower.     For example, on the first 350 tons of production, a grower would receive 6 cts per lb in fiscal 1988, 4.5 cts in 1989, 3 cts in 1990 and 1.5 cts in 1991.     The income payments would be based on the amount of commercially recoverable sugar produced by a farmer in the 1985 or 1986 crop years, whichever is less, USDA said.     Myers said the administration is proposing drastic changes in the sugar program because the current high price support is causing adverse trends in the sugar industry.     He said the current program has artificially stimulated domestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowed corn sweeteners to make market inroads.     U.S. sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in a "progressive contraction" of the sugar import quota to only one mln short tons this year, he said. This has hurt cane sugar refiners who rely on imported sugar processing.     Furthermore, USDA said the current sugar program gives overseas manufacturers of sugar-containing products a competitive advantage. The result has been higher imports of sugar-containing products and a flight of U.S. processing facilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar.     USDA also said the current program imposes a heavy cost on U.S. consumers and industrial users. In fiscal 1987, USDA said consumers are paying nearly two billion dlrs more than necessary for sugar.     "Enactment of this bill will reduce the price gap between sweeteners and help to correct or stabilize the many adverse impacts and trends which the sugar industry is currently facing," Myers said.     The following table lists the rate of payments, in cts per lb, to growers and the quantity covered, in short tons recoverable raw sugar, under the administration's proposal to compensate sugar growers with targeted payments.

Tehran radio, monitored by the BBC, quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying any attempt at interference would be met by "a strong response from Iran and other Moslems in the world."      U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger, in remarks apparently unrelated to the broadcast, said the U.S. Would do whatever was necessary to keep shipping lanes open in the face of new Iranian anti-ship missiles in the Gulf.     The U.S. State Department said two days ago Tehran had been told of U.S. Concern that Iranian anti-ship missiles posed a threat to the free flow of oil from the Gulf.     U.S. Officials have said Iran has new Chinese-made anti-ship "Silkworm" missiles, which pose a greater threat to merchant ships than missiles used before.     The Iranian spokesman said the reports that Iran intended to attack ships were "misleading propaganda."     He said Iraq's President Saddam Hussein was the main cause of tension in the Gulf and said Iran would continue to use "all its legitimate means to stem the cause of tension."     Weinberger said in a television interview in the U.S. "We are fully prepared to do what's necessary to keep the shipping going and keep the freedom of navigation available in that very vital waterway."     "We aren't going into any disclosures or discussions of what might happen, but we are certainly very sympathetic to and listening carefully to any suggestions for our assistance in keeping navigation free in that area," he said.     Weinberger said U.S warship movements in the Gulf area were not unusual.     A U.S. Navy battle group led by the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk is currently in the northern Arabian Sea.     The Iranian spokesman was quoted by Tehran radio as saying the U.S. Was trying to build up its military presence in the region.  REUTER ;
TEST;23-MAR-1987 08:03:48.25;CASH CRISIS HITS UGANDAN COFFEE BOARD;  Uganda's state-run Coffee Marketing Board (CMB) has been suffering a cash crisis for the past two months due to a bottleneck in export shipments and administrative delays in handling payments, trade sources said.     The CMB needs between 10 and 15 billion shillings (the equivalent of seven to 10 mln dlrs) to pay farmers and processors for coffee already delivered, but its present export revenue is insufficient to cover such expenditure, they said.     The board's cash crisis has serious implications for the economy as a whole, since coffee accounts for 95 pct of Uganda's total exports.     The CMB's financial difficulties first started in January following delays in rail-freighting export consignments of coffee to the ports of Mombasa, Dar es Salaam and Tanga.     These delays were caused by a shortage of railway wagons in Uganda and bottlenecks on the ferries which transport Ugandan wagons across Lake Victoria to link up with the Kenyan and Tanzanian railway systems, the sources said     Marketing Minister John Sebaana-Kizito publicly acknowledged on February 19 that the CMB had run up arrears to local suppliers as a result of the shortage of transport for moving exports.     Sebaana-Kizito said at the time that the payments squeeze would be resolved in two weeks.     However, an accident to the rail ferry which plies between the Ugandan lake port of Jinja and Kisumu in Kenya put it out of action between February 21 and March 15, causing fresh delays in cargo movements.     Coffee exports are especially sensitive to the disruption of rail transport since president Yoweri Museveni has banned their haulage by road in a drive to save transport costs.     Transport difficulties meant that by early February the CMB was holding unsold coffee stocks of around 750,000 bags.     These stocks were equivalent to one quarter of Uganda's expected three mln 60-kilo bag 1986/87 (October-September) crop, the sources said.     According to the sources, the board's financial problems have been aggravated by long delays in processing export receipts.     The coffee board was taking about eight weeks to recycle export receipts into payments to local producers, whereas export bills handled by local banks took half that time to process, they said.     The sources said the CMB's price structure had been overtaken by Uganda's high inflation rate, unofficially estimated at about 200 pct, and that this was a further disincentive to producers, already owed large arrears.     "The coffee pricing structure is wrong and three months behind, the foreign exchange rate is unrealistic, and the sooner the so-called economic package is put in top gear, the better for the coffee industry and the economy as a whole," one of the sources said.     The government is currently negotiating a package of economic reforms with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund aimed at underpinning a renewed inflow of foreign aid to help Uganda's economic recovery after 15 years of political strife.

TEST;23-MAR-1987 11:04:14.16;ZINC PRODUCERS APPROACH EC ON VOLUNTARY CLOSURES;  A number of individual zinc producing companies have approached the European Commission to sound out its reaction to a possible industry plan for a voluntary reduction of smelting capacity, Commission sources said.     The companies have been told that the Commission could not judge whether a plan would be acceptable under European Community, EC, competition rules until it had full details, they said.     In 1983, the industry drew up a plan envisaging the loss of about 130,000 tonnes of annual capacity, or about 10 pct of the total.     However, the industry did not proceed with this plan as zinc market conditions improved in 1984, the sources noted.     They said the companies which approached the Commission recently -- and which they did not name -- appeared to envisage a loss of productive capacity similar to that proposed in 1983.  Reuter ;

TEST;23-MAR-1987 19:32:46.99;CBI SURVEY POINTS TO SURGE IN U.K. OUTPUT;  British manufacturers expect output to grow rapidly in the four coming months, a Confederation of British Industry (CBI) survey shows.     The CBI's monthly trends survey for March shows that 43 pct of the 1,685 polled U.K. Firms expect to raise output in the next four months. Only nine pct expect output to fall while 47 pct said production would likely remain unchanged.     The CBI said the positive balance between firms expecting production to rise and those forecasting a fall, at 34 pct, was the highest such figure recorded since 1977.     In the CBI's February survey, 37 pct of companies expected a rise in output while 54 pct forecast production would remain at present levels and eight pct expected production to drop.     The survey also showed that 23 pct of the polled companies consider current order books to be above normal while 58 pct view them as normal and only 19 pct regard them as below normal.     This was the highest positive balance since the question was first asked more than 10 years ago, the CBI said.     In February, the figures were 24 pct, 22 pct and 54 pct respectively.     Companies also rated their export possibilities higher. Of all polled companies, 23 pct rated their export order books to be above normal and 53 pct described them as normal while only 23 pct believed export orders were below normal levels.     In February, 25 pct thought their export books were below normal and 50 pct believed them to be about normal. At 23 pct, the proportion of companies rating their export books above normal was unchanged between February and March.     On prices, the survey showed that 62 pct of companies expect average prices at which domestic orders are booked will remain unchanged in the coming four months, up from 57 pct in February.     From 38 pct in February, only 31 pct of firms now expect prices to rise before July. Six pct forecast prices will fall, against four pct a month earlier.     Commenting on the survey, CBI economic situation committee chairman David Wigglesworth said sterling's more competitive level against many European currencies had improved exports.     "But interest rates are still much higher than in our competitor countries and British manufacturers will still have to work hard to win new business both in overseas markets and in the substitution of British-made goods for imports here at home," he said.

TEST;24-MAR-1987 05:25:16.15;PHILIPPINE TRADE SECRETARY PLEASED WITH GATT TALKS;     By Christopher Pritchett, Reuters Philippine Secretary of Trade and Industry Jose Concepcion, who two days ago expressed doubts about agreements produced at international conferences, said he was pleased with the latest gathering here.     Concepcion told Reuters in an interview that the informal General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting gave ministers from more than 20 nations the chance to examine issues with which GATT did not have the political will to deal.     "Also, the role of the developing countries has been emphasised in this particular meeting. Somehow it has been the perception of developing countries that GATT is a club of rich countries," he added in an interview with Reuters.     "In fact many of the issues that have been tabled for discussion (in the Uruguay round of trade negotiations) will be of more benefit to the developed countries," he said.     Concepcion said at the start of the Taupo meeting that the Uruguay round was meant to be a "shining act of faith" in the world trade system.     Concepcion said the Philippines would address the issues of trade in tropical fruit and the improvement of GATT machinery to make it more responsive.     He said tropical fruit came from developing countries but faced non-tariff barriers, quantitative restrictions or very high duties in other nations. Concepcion named Japan and South Korea as examples.     He said he would go to Wellington for talks with New Zealand, which had a surplus in trade with the Philippines, to encourage it to switch imports from other countries. He noted that New Zealand bought its bananas from Ecuador.  REUTER ;

TEST;24-MAR-1987 07:23:18.87;JAPAN ECONOMY MAY START BOTTOMING OUT SOON -AGENCY;  Japan's economy remains sluggish but is beginning to show signs it may bottom out soon, the Economic Planning Agency said in a monthly report submitted to Cabinet ministers.     But a bottoming out of the economy depends largely on the yen's exchange rate trend in the immediate future, Agency officials said.     The officials told reporters industrial production, down 0.5 pct in January from December, is likely to turn positive in February and to rise thereafter, raising hopes for a brighter economic outlook.     The Agency predicted industrial production will grow 2.5 pct in the current January/March quarter after falling 0.7 pct in the previous quarter.     A rise of this size would be the largest since the fourth quarter of 1984 when industrial output rose 2.7 pct, the officials said.     They also said an expected upturn in exports would be a mixed blessing as it would contribute to economic growth but would increase the chance of trade friction.     Japanese exports contracted five pct in February from January but are likely to grow from March if the yen stabilizes around current levels, the officials said.     They predicted exports will increase by 2.3 pct in the January/March quarter from the October/December quarter.     "But the problem is imports are not expanding," said one official. Imports fell by 9.4 pct in February from January.  REUTER ;

TEST;24-MAR-1987 14:25:59.15;CONRAC <CAX> SOARS FOLLOWING MARK IV <IV> BID;     By Cal Mankowski, Reutersd Heavy buying by speculators boosted Conrac Corp 7-7/8 to 29, higher than a 25-dlr-per-share cash tender offer announced by Mark IV Industries Inc <IV>.     "It's a case of ChemLawn euphoria," said one arbitrageur, referring to a recent hostile tender that began at 27 dlrs per share and ended when ChemLawn Corp <CHEM> found a white knight willing to bid 36.50 dlrs.     For Conrac, the arbitrageur said, 28 dlrs per share seemed like an "appropriate price." Another said "it's too early to project the outcome."     "The market is speaking for itself and saying the 25 dlr offer is inadequate," the second arbitrageur said. But he added it was hard to make a case for Conrac being worth much more than the 29 dlrs where the shares traded today.     He noted the stock recently sold in the high teens and there could be a downward risk of 10 dlrs or more if Conrac is able to thwart Mark IV.     Conrac urged shareholders to take no action while its board studies the offer and confers with advisers. Conrac said it would make a recommendation by April 17.     A third arbitrageur noted Mark IV had been involved in several takeovers previously and has proven itself to be a determined bidder. "They're not beginners," he said.     Another said Conrac might have trouble if it tried to find another buyer. "It's a hodge-podge of non-related businesses," he said. "There is only a small universe of people who would want to own the company as it's presently structured."     Conrac is involved in video displays, computer software, aircraft instruments, telephone answering machines, welding equipment and other products.     "I'm telling retail clients to sell and leave the rest for those who can take the risk," said Rudolph Hokanson, analyst at Milwaukee Co.     He called the 25-dlr offer by Mark IV "fair value but on the low side." "I don't think management was looking for a buyer in any way before this offer," he said.     Hokanson said Conrac has conservative finances and has developed a reputation for quality products that serve niche markets. He said management has done a good job of turning around the telephone answering machine business.  Reuter ;

Results of an economic evaluation of the find, in which Placer has an option with <Australian Consolidated Minerals Ltd> (ACM) to earn a 50 pct interest, were encouraging enough to warrant a full study, Placer said in a statement.     Big Bell, in the Murchison goldfield 540 km north east of Perth, was founded in 1904. Between 1937 and 1955 it yielded 22.8 tonnes of gold and 7.8 tonnes of silver while milling about 30,000 tonnes of ore a month.     Placer has said the prospect has an estimated 14 mln tonnes of ore with a three-gram-per-tonne concentration accessible by open-pit mining and a further 4.5 mln tonnes with a 4.4-gram-a-tonne concentration between 300 and 600 meters underground.     It said it was obliged to produce the feasibility study no later than December 31 this year by which time it would have spent three mln dlrs on Big Bell.

TEST;25-MAR-1987 17:46:02.58;GENCORP <GY> BID COULD BE RAISED, GROUP SAYS;     BY CAL MANKOWSKI, Reuters An investor group said it might be willing to raise its 100 dlr per share offer for GenCorp but so far the company has turned down requests for a meeting.     "We might be able to see some additional value if we could meet" and get more financial data, said Joel Reed, speaking for the investor group.     Reed told Reuters that GenCorp chairman A. William Reynolds "was not interested in sitting down and talking with us at this time." Cyril Wagner sought the meeting in a recent telephone conversation with Reynolds, Reed said.     Wagner and Brown, along with AFG Industries Inc <AFG>, recently launched a surprise tender offer for GenCorp. The offer is worth 2.23 billion dlrs.     Reed said under the circumstances the 100 dlr per share tender offer, which expires April 15, is a fair offer. GenCorp gained 3-1/2 to 114 today on the NYSE.     Reed outlined a plan to reshape GenCorp in the event his group wins control. He said aerospace, soft drink bottling and entertainment units are potential divestiture candidates. He said the tire business, which the group wants to keep, may be more viable if merged with another tire company.     "One option would be to try to grow the tire business through combination or an acquisition," Reed said. He said he believes such a merger could create a stronger force in the tire industry.     Gary Miller, chief financial officer of AFG, said his company has a record of acquiring mature businesses and boosting productivity. Automation and incentives tied to profit sharing have been used with success, he said.     In the case of GenCorp's RKO General broadcasting stations, Reed said the plan of the partners is to step into GenCorp's shoes and proceed with plans to  sell the stations.     The partners said if they succed in acquiring GenCorp they intend to consummate sale of WOR-TV in New York to MCA Inc <MCA>. GenCorp last year entered into an agreement to sell the station for 387 mln dlrs.     The partners also said if they acquire Gencorp they would also proceed with the proposed sale of KHJ-TV in Los Angeles to Walt Disney Co <DIS>. RKO General would receive 217 mln dlrs and Fidelilty Television, which challenged the license, would get about 103 mln dlrs.     The partners also said the Federal Communications Commission established an expedited schedule for receiving comments on their request for special temporary authorization of proposed trust arrangements while the FCC considers a formal application for transfer of the broadcast unit.     Reed said he was pleased with the expedited schedule because it provides time for the agency to act on the request before the expiration of the tender offer.     He said it was the aim of the partners to move as quickly as possible to eliminate uncertainty surrounding the stations.     Asked about criticism of the takeover attempt voiced by some municipal officials in Akron, Ohio, where GenCorp is headquartered, Reed said, "the plan of the partners offers long term growth for Ohio."     He noted that the aerospace business, slated for divestiture under the partners' plan, is located in California. "Our program is one that overall would provide the greatest long term growth for all segments," he said.  Reuter ;

Previously, the company had said first quarter results would likely be lower than for the 1986 period due to production disruptions caused by the large number of production line changes scheduled during the first quarter, its statement pointed out.

Some 840,000 hectares of farmland have been planted with cash crops including sugar cane, peanuts and soybeans, 67,000 ha more than in 1986.     The provincial government has increased investment in grain and taken effective measures to combat natural disasters this year, the agency said, but gave no further details.  REUTER ;
TEST;31-MAR-1987 09:04:37.13;LONDON MEAT FUTURES NEED MARKETING - CHAIRMAN;  Pigmeat and beef futures, which have been thinly traded on the London Meat Futures Exchange, LMFE, despite lower physical prices and the introduction of new contracts, need more effective marketing, LMFE chairman Pat Elmer said in his annual report.     In 1986 the Exchange introduced live cattle and pig cash settlement contracts, representing a move away from the problems of cash distortions and squeezes, which initial deliverable "buyers option" contracts created, he said.     Although the physical industry is aware of the market and follows its prices keenly, this has not been reflected in market volume, Elmer said.     "If we are to achieve our true potential the floor members must give the market much more time and attention," he added.  Reuter ;
TEST;31-MAR-1987 10:07:18.59;U.S. FACTORY ORDERS ROSE 4.3 PCT IN FEBRUARY;  New orders for manufactured goods rose 8.0 billion dlrs, or 4.3 pct, in February to a seasonally adjusted 194.6 billion dlrs, the Commerce Department said.     It was the largest one month rise in orders since a 4.8 pct increase in September 1986, the department said.     The February gain followed a revised orders drop in January of 5.3 pct, the largest drop on record since the department revised the statistics in 1982.     The January decline was originally reported as 4.0 pct.     Excluding defense orders factory orders rose 3.2 pct in February after a 3.9 pct January decline.     The new orders rise in February included an increase in durable goods orders of 6.4 billion dlrs, or 6.7 pct, to 101.9 billion dlrs. The department had estimated on March 24 that February durable goods orders rose 6.0 pct.     New orders for nondurable goods  were up 1.6 billion dlrs, or 1.8 pct, in February to 92.7 billion dlrs, the department said.     These figures compared with a January decline of 9.8 pct in durables orders and no change in nondurables orders in January.     Defense orders rose 2.2 billion dlrs, or 47.8 pct, in February after falling 38.5 pct in January.     Orders for nondefense capital goods gained a slight 0.1 pct in February after falling 8.6 pct in January.     Within major industry categories, orders increases were widespread.

TEST;31-MAR-1987 13:03:09.88;GENCORP <GY> ALTERNATIVE PLAN DUE WITHIN A WEEK;  A. William Reynolds, chairman and chief executive of GenCorp Inc, told shareholders he expects to announce a company alternative to a 100-dlr-per-share hostile tender within a week.     Last night the company urged shareholders to reject the tender. Reynolds urged shareholders to be patient, saying the group sponsoring the tender offer had months to evaluate GenCorp while "we have had only 10 days to respond."     Reynolds also disclosed the company has resolved legal challenges to its planned sale of WOR TV, serving the New York City market, and expects to complete the sale by Friday.     Reynolds said the company expects to book an after tax gain of 250 mln dlrs from the sale of WOR TV. The company plans to sell the station to MCA Inc <MCA> for 387 mln dlrs.     Reynolds did not specify whether the legal challenges were dropped or dismissed. The Federal Communications Commission has already approved the station's sale.     Money from the sale of the station will play a role in helping develop an alternative to the tender offer co-sponsored by AFG Industries Inc <AFG> and Wagner and Brown, Reynolds said. He provided no other details.     Randall Hubbard, chairman of AFG, and Joel Reed, chief financial officer of Wagner and Brown, attended the meeting, which was shifted from a tire plant to a downtown hotel. About 300 people were present despite an overnight snowstorm.     Hubbard and Reed chatted briefly with Reynolds after the meeting but declined to discuss their proposal with reporters.     Reynolds told the shareholders friends and family members have been telling him "Bill, just don't pay greenmail" to end the takeover threat. Greenmail describes a buyout of a minority shareholder at a price not available to other holders. Reynolds said he considers it a "repugnant device."     Shareholders elected management's slate of 11 directors. Mario Gabelli, head of a New York investment firm which owns a large block of stock, proposed one nominee for the board. Gabelli said the unsuccessful attempt was designed to "stiffen the backbone of the board to discourage greenmail."     Hubbard and Reed reiterated previous statements that they are open to negotiations with GenCorp.     Asked about severance contracts for key executives in the event of a shift in control of the company, Reynolds asserted "we're developing alternatives that would not result in a change in control."     Asked whether the company's plan would be superior to any proposal of AFG and Wagner and Brown, Reynolds commented, "We know the company, we know the values and we know the opportunities better than any outside group."     In response to a question about whether any units are up for sale, he said only that GenCorp is evaluating alternatives.  Reuter ;

TEST; 1-APR-1987 06:13:40.77;INDIAN RATE CUTS TO SPARK INDUSTRY, AGRICULTURE;  The Indian Finance Ministry's announcement in Parliament yesterday, changing the nation's interest rate structure, will benefit industry and agriculture by providing loans at lower interest, bankers and brokers said.     The changes, effective today, included reducing commercial bank lending rates that have ranged between 15 pct and 17.5 pct by one percentage point.     New rates, which affect both Indian and foreign banks, also include a one percentage point gain, to an annual 10 pct, on deposits of two years or more but less than five.     Bank deposits of five years or more carrying 11 pct interest have been abolished.     Bankers said the interest rate modifications reflect the government's concern to reduce the costs of borrowing and help improve world competitiveness of Indian goods.     There is likely to be a shift to short-term bank deposits by long-term depositors, bankers predicted. This will create the flexibility to draw and re-invest funds in either equity shares or short-term bank deposits, they said.     A merchant banker also said reduced manufacturing costs due to lower lending rates are likely to boost the share market.     Tata Steel, a trend setter on the Bombay Stock Exchange, opened today higher at 1,040 rupees against yesterday's closing of 1,012.50 rupees.     A stockbroker said investors may be less enthusiastic now to buy convertible and non-convertible debentures because the Finance Ministry has reduced the annual interest rate to 12.5 pct and 14 pct respectively from 13.5 and 15 pct respectively.     "But overall debenture prospects remain bright because the rates of interest on them will still be higher than what banks pay for deposits of similar maturity," a merchant banker said.  REUTER ;

TEST; 7-APR-1987 18:40:15.30;SENATE REPORT - REAGAN PLANS EARLY SDI DEPLOYMENT;  The Reagan administration is secretly developing plans for an early deployment of President Reagan's controversial "Star Wars" anti-missile system, according to a Senate study.     "Near-term deployment is an absurd and dangerous course for America," said Sen. Bennett Johnston in a statement issued with the report. "It would force us to break the bank, throw out the ABM treaty and commit us to an arms race in space."     The Reagan administration is engaged in an internal debate over the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), as the land and space-based anti-missile system is called, and may decide later this month to reinterpret the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty to justify an acceleration of SDI research to include development and space testing.     Johnston, of Louisiana, and fellow Democrat William Proxmire of Wisconsin, whose staff prepared the report, accused the administration of covertly seeking early  deployment as a political ploy to commit the United States to strategic defenses even after Reagan leaves office in 1989.     "This report exposes the fact that without a presidential directive or congressional consent, the SDI program ... is being changed to pursue a near-term deployment of strategic defenses," Proxmire, chairman of the powerful Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, said.     "In other words, they're covertly reorienting the SDI program without congressional approval."     Reuter ;

A High Command communique said Iraqi troops had won a significant victory and were continuing to advance.     Iraq said it had foiled a three-pronged thrust some 10 km (six miles) from Basra, but admitted the Iranians had occupied ground held by the Mohammed al-Qassem unit, one of three divisions attacked.     The communique said Iranian Revolutionary Guards were under assault from warplanes, helicopter gunships, heavy artillery and tanks.     "Our forces are continuing their advance until they purge the last foothold" occupied by the Iranians, it said.     (Iran said its troops had killed or wounded more than 4,000 Iraqis and were stabilising their new positions.)     The Baghdad communique said Iraqi planes also destroyed oil installations at Iran's southwestern Ahvaz field during a raid today. It denied an Iranian report that an Iraqi jet was shot down.     Iraq also reported a naval battle at the northern tip of the Gulf. Iraqi naval units and forces defending an offshore terminal sank six Iranian out of 28 Iranian boats attempting to attack an offshore terminal, the communique said.      Reuter ;

The report, dated March 24, noted Parana accounts for about 20 to 24 pct of Brazil's total soybean crop.     It said generally favorable weather from early December through February helped compensate for earlier dryness.     However, hot, dry weather during the past 20 to 30 days followed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the second week of march has raised concern about late planted soybeans which are still immature, but the impact may be localized, the report said.     The corn crop is expected to be a record and will create serious storage problems, the report said.     Due to favorable support prices, corn area increased by more than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans, and yields are expected to be above average, it said.     Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn crop crop has been harvested.     During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grain elevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn, the report said.     New crop wheat plantings are expected to decline  -- Parana accounts for about 60 pct of total production. Major reasons for the decline are expected reduced government support price and good summer crop harvests.  Reuter ;

"I just just don't believe that it (Texaco Canada) would be part of any settlement," Bijur said during a interview.     Bijur said he could not comment directly on the Texaco-Penzoil dispute, adding he had no first-hand information concerning efforts by Texaco and Penzoil to resolve the matter.     "We don't have any problems that I am aware of that are a result of that litigation in the United States, and we continue to do business on a normal, 'business as usual' basis," Texaco Canada's Bijur told reporters during an interview session.     As previously reported, Texaco Inc is seeking a court order to block Pennzoil from taking action to secure a 10.3 billion dlr judgement against Texaco.     In reply to a query, Bijur said Texaco Inc has imposed no spending retraints on Texaco Canada as it continues previously reported efforts to make an energy-related acquisition.     After considering making an acquisition for several months, Texaco Canada set up a "business development team" of five people about one month ago to increase its efforts, Bijur said. The company has also widened the scope of its search to include candidates involved in refining and marketing as well as production segments of the industry.     "We're going to widen the scope of our view. We're going to look at the downstream and we're going to look at the entire petroleum business," he said.     Bijur declined to specify how much money Texaco Canada would spend on an acquisition.     Bijur said the company was not close to concluding any acquisitions and declined to specify when he expected a transaction might be made. "We're not in a hurry," he said.     Texaco Canada said in the annual report it had a cash position of 808 mln dlrs at the end of 1986, and Bijur said the company's cash fund has not changed materially during the first quarter.     Commenting on earnings results, Bijur said he expected first quarter profit to be lower than last year's earnings of 84 mln dlrs or 70 cts a share, due to lower profit contribution from production because of lower oil prices.

But some unions, including those of building and mining workers, said they were dissatisfied with the deal and would continue their strikes for a few more days.     State officials said the government had agreed to revise its proposals to cut compensation and would allow slightly higher cash benefits for injured workers.     Under the original proposal, which sparked strikes and other industrial action in the state on April 7, workers' compensation would have been cut by one third. Full details of the compromise package are not yet known.     The Labour Council, affiliated to the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), had threatened to paralyse New South Wales unless the government modified its pending legislation on the issue.     State officials said the only sectors affected in the past three days were some government building projects, railway freight movement and cargo handling in Sydney's ports.  REUTER ;
TEST;13-APR-1987 09:02:34.57;PORTUGUESE ECONOMY REMAINS BUOYANT DESPITE CRISIS;     By Pascal Fletcher, Reuters Portugal's economy, which has been enjoying one of its most buoyant periods in more than a decade, may now be strong enough to shrug off the country's latest government crisis, analysts said.     But the April 3 ousting of Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva's government could slow economic reforms and investment as Portugal continues to adapt to membership in the European Community, which it joined in January last year, they said.     Cavaco Silva's minority Social Democratic Party, PSD, was toppled in a parliamentary censure vote by left-wing parties.     The centre-right administration had made economic growth reform a priority in its 17 months in office.     In 1986, Portugal's economy grew four pct, its current account surplus swelled to more than one billion dlrs and inflation fell to 10 pct, from 20 pct in 1985.     Analysts and businessmen said the prospects of instability were worrying but they felt the foundations for continued growth had not been badly shaken.     "The economy has developed a certain self-confidence that is now less dependent on the political situation," said Fritz Haser, economics professor at Universidade Livre, Lisbon.     "The market doesn't see this as a real crisis yet," economist Jorge Braga de Macedo told Reuters.     Businessmen have identified political instability over the last 13 years as one of the biggest obstacles to lasting economic progress.     The PSD administration was the 16th formed since the 1974 revolution.     Portugal's developing stock markets, however, remain buoyant. Brokers and unit trust managers said the recent surge in economic confidence under the PSD rule was still largely underpinned by continuing optimistic forecasts.     Investment grew nearly 10 pct in 1986 and a Bank of Portugal forecast, released on the day the PSD government fell, predicted the pace of investment and overall economic growth would remain at similar levels this year.     But analysts said the crisis interrupted current policies and could slow economic development.     Soares, who is expected to announce a decision by the end of the month, can either call early elections or form a new government from parties in the existing left wing-dominated parliament.     Many businessmen said they strongly favoured quick elections as the best solution. "There is a good chance that a majority government could result from early elections," Confederation of Portuguese Industry (CIP) president Pedro Ferraz da Costa said.     He said they were optimistic this could mean the continuation in the near future of liberalisation policies introduced over the last year.     The left-wing parties favour a parliamentary solution, but the PSD said it wants an early election in which opinion polls say they could win an overall majority.     A PSD majority would also open the way for more wide-ranging reforms, such as relaxation of labour laws and possible denationalisation of industry, the analysts said.     Cavaco Silva has accused the left-wing opposition parties of blocking key economic reforms.     The left-wingers said Portugal's positive economic results were more the product of favourable international conditions such as cheaper oil and raw material imports, than of PSD policies.  REUTER ;

In its document on the auctions, the Bank said "The Bank is content for such (when-issued) trading to cevelop subject to certain conditions, in particular for predential supervision of the credit risk to which the gilt-edged market makers and Inter-dealer brokers may become exposed."     The Bank is widely expected to require dealers to report wehn-issued trading positions on a daily basis.     When-issued trading presents certain unusual risks because dealers are buying and selling a security that technically does not exist although there is no uncertainty about when it will be issued.     Still, the fact there is no physical delivery possible presents certain credit risks as well.     The Bank is widely expected to expand its reporting requiremenmts for unsettled trades, requiring firms to report unsettled when-issued trades one day after they occur. Normally, unsettled trades must be reported three days after they occur.  REUTER ;

"We've no plan to bid," Blair told reporters after a speech to a business group, although he stressed that Nova and 57 pct-owned Husky Oil Ltd <HYO> were interested in Dome's extensive Western Canadian energy holdings.     "But being interested can sometimes be different from making a bid," Blair said.     TransCanada PipeLines Ltd <TRP> yesterday bid 4.30 billion dlrs for Dome, but Dome said it was discontinuing talks with TransCanada and was considering a proposal from another company and was also talking with another possible buyer, both rumored to be offshore.     Asked by reporters if Dome should remain in Canadian hands, Blair replied, "Yes. I think that we still need to be building as much Canadian position in this industry as we can and I think it would be best if Dome ends up in the hands of Canadian management."     He said he did not know who other possible bidders were.     Blair said that any move to put Dome's financial house in order "will remove one of the general problems of attitude that have hung over Western Canadian industry."     He added, however, that the energy industry still faced "a couple of tough, tough additional years."     Asked about Nova's 1987 prospects, Blair predicted that Nova's net profit would rise this year to more than 150 mln dlrs from last year's net profit of 100.2 mln dlrs due to improved product prices and continued cost-cutting.

He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that the six nations have taken measures, including market intervention, to support the dollar above that level.     Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told the same committee that the six - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - had intervened aggressively since the dollar fell below 150 yen.     Miyazawa said major nations are trying hard to stabilize exchange rates.     Asked if there had been any change in the fundamentals of each nation since the February 22 Paris accord, he said he did not think the fundamentals themselves had changed substantially.     But he said the market is sensitively looking at what is happening in major nations. He did not elaborate.

TEST; 8-APR-1987 07:10:38.80;NORWAY TO TIGHTEN RULES FOR REGISTERING LOANS;  Norway will from June require finance institutions and insurance companies to report lending volume to the central bank once a month rather than quarterly in a bid to tighten domestic lending, Finance Ministry officials said.     Norwegian Bank Association President Trond Reinertsen told Reuters the new rule would make it more difficult for banks to transfer funds to financial and insurance companies for lending.     Banks have in the past used the two month lapse in loan registration to transfer money for lending to finance and insurance groups to avoid penalty reserve requirements for lending in excess of government set ceilings.     The new rule brings loan reporting requirements for insurance and finance companies in line with those already applied to commercial banks, Ministry officials said.     Borrowers have increasingly sought loans from finance and insurance companies after the central bank last year clamped down on what it called excessive bank lending.     Bank lending dropped by five billion crowns in January from 260 billion crowns the previous month in response to the stricter penalty reserve requirements, Oslo bankers said.     They said recent central bank cuts in the overnight rate it charges banks might offset new pressure on interest rates.  REUTER ;

TEST;13-APR-1987 12:12:46.45;U.S. AUTOWORKERS SET FOR TOUGH BARGAINING ROUND;  The United Automobile Workers Union, UAW, is asking local leaders to back a renewed drive for higher wages in upcoming bargaining with the car and other major industries while acknowledging that futher job losses are inevitable as traditional U.S. manufacturing shrinks.     The UAW will begin bargaining this summer on new contracts covering some 380,000 members at General Motors Corp, the world's largest corporation, and nearly 110,000 members at Ford Motor Co, the number two U.S. automaker.     National UAW labor contracts at both companies expire at midnight September 14.     The union is expected to chose one of the companies as a possible strike target in early September to concentrate its efforts.     UAW president Owen Bieber was loudly cheered by some 3,000 local delegates at a special bargaining strategy convention yesterday when he declared the union is ready to go to "war" against the major auto makers in support of its goals.     "It takes two to make peace, but only one to make war ... and if it's war, the UAW will be ready for it. War against the insecurity of layoff," the UAW chief said.     In a 101-page document proposing its 1987 collective bargaining program, the leadership of the 1.1 mln member union urged "full resumption of our traditional wage formula" as "a top priority in this round of bargaining."     But the union concedes that increased foreign competition, new technology and shifts to low-cost offshore production by U.S. manufacturers will continue to cut the number of workers in the motor vehicle and agricultural equipment industries.     Union leaders told Reuters the 1987 round of bargaining with GM and Ford will be one of the most difficult in the 51-year history of the union in view of GM's announced goal to close plants it deems non-competitive and to increase its purchase of parts from outside suppliers as part of a massive program to reduce its costs by 10 billion dlrs and reverse the profits decline it suffered the last two years.     At Ford, where a record 3.3 billion dlrs in profits last year swelled its cash reserves past eight billion dlrs, analysts say the company's healthy position could make it a tempting target for the union in its drive to increase wages.     Labor executives for both GM and Ford have said they will oppose any attempt to return to annual general wage increases that were dropped in 1982 when the Detroit-based industry was mired in a deep recession.     But the UAW, pointing to a three pct pay increase to be implemented later this year in the contract it negotiated with Chrysler Corp after a 1985 strike, said it intends to seek full reinstatement of annual percentage wage increases in this year's bargaining with GM and Ford.

TEST;11-MAR-1987 13:19:42.46;EL PASO ELECTRIC <ELPA> REACHES NEW MEXICO PACT;  El Paso Electric Co said it has agreed to limit rate increases in its New Mexico service territory to a maximum of nine pct over the next three years.     Last year, about 18 pct of the utility's revenues came from New Mexico, 70 pct from retail electricity sales in Texas and 12 pct from wholesale sales under federal regulation.     In January the company filed a formal rate case with New Mexico regulators seeking a 21.66 pct increase in its annual rates there which would have been equal to about 13.9 mln dlrs net of fuel savings.     El Paso Electric said it reached a stipulated settlement on its New Mexico rates with several parties, including the state of the New Mexico Public Service Commission, which provides for rate treatment of the utility's investment in the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station located near Phoenix, Ariz.     The company said commission hearings on the stipulated settlement are expected to start next month. If it is approved, the new rates could go into effect as early as this summer. El Paso Electric's January rate case will remain before the commission pending approval of the settlement.     El Paso Electric said the agreement provides got continued full inclusion in its rate base of the costs of Palo Verda Unit one, maximum rate increases of three pct on a cents per kilowatt hour basis in 1987, 1988 and 1989, and no further rate increases until 1994.     Once the agreement is approved, the utility would still have to prove cost of service increases to support at least the maximum increase each year, a spokesman explained.     The company said it will attempt to settle the cost of service issues in timed to allow the new rates to go into effect this summer.     El Paso Electric said the agreement allows recovery in its New Mexico rates of lease payments in connection with the utility's 1986 sale and leaseback of its investment in Palo Verde Unit Two to the extent of the book value sold.     The company said it agreed that none of its costs for Palo Verde Unit Three will be included in its New Mexico rates.     The utility said the agreement also resolves any issue relating to the prudence of the planning, management and construction of Palo Verde and settles any possible issue of excess generating capacity through 1993.     El Paso Electric said it does not expect to have excess generating capacity.     The agreement also provides that any portion of the cost of service deferrals not recouped prior to December 31, 1994 will not be recovered through New Mexico rates, the company said, adding it expects to recoup all deferrals in full by that date.

TEST;11-MAR-1987 18:14:49.93;U.S. ECONOMIC DATA KEY TO DEBT FUTURES OUTLOOK;     By Brad Schade, Reuters U.S. economic data this week could be the key in determining whether U.S. interest rate futures break out of a 3-1/2 month trading range, financial analysts said.     Although market expectations are for February U.S. retail sales Thursday and industrial production Friday to show healthy gains, figures within or slightly below expectations would be positive for the market, the analysts said.     "You have to be impressed with the resiliency of bonds right now," said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig Sloane.     Treasury bond futures came under pressure today which traders linked to a persistently firm federal funds rate and a rise in oil prices. However, when sufficient selling interest to break below chart support in the June contract failed to materialize, participants who had sold bond futures early quickly covered short positions, they said.     "Everyone is expecting strong numbers, and if they come in as expected it won't be that bad for the market," Sloane said.     Sloane said the consensus estimate for the non-auto sector of retail sales is for a rise of 0.6 to 0.7 pct.     Dean Witter analyst Karen Gibbs said a retail sales figure below market forecasts would give a boost to debt futures, and she put the range for the non-auto sector of retail sales at up 0.8 to 1.2 pct.     Industrial production and the producer price index Friday both are expected to show increases of about 0.5 pct, she added.     Retail sales "will tell us whether or not we will be able to fill the gap," Gibbs said, referring to a chart gap in June bonds between 100-26/32 and 101-3/32 created Friday. June bonds closed at 100-4/32 today.     Also key to debt futures direction, in addition to the federal funds rate, is the direction of crude oil prices, said Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures analyst Brian Singer.     "A higher fed funds rate and firm oil prices precluded the market from breaking out of the trading range the last time the market approached the top of the range," Singer said.     In order for bonds to break above the top of the range, which is just below 102 in the June contract, "the crude oil rally needs to run its course and pull back a little bit," Singer said. "Fed funds are already easing back down toward the six pct level."     The recent surge in oil prices has also been a concern to Manufacturers Hanover Futures analyst Jim Rozich, but the rally may be nearing a top around 18.50 dlrs per barrel, he said.     Rozich said he is looking for the June bond contract to ease to 99-6/32 and find support.     "I'm not quite ready to jump on the bullish bandwagon yet. The jury is still out this week," Rozich said.  Reuter ;

The statement said the request for the withdrawal of the troops was made because of the calmness reigning in all of its refineries.     "The request was also due to the end of the seamen's strike and the willingness of the oil industry workers to sit again by the negotiating table," the statement said.     Even though the Petrobras statement said the seamen's strike was over, a union spokesman said only two small shipping companies had reached a pay agreement. The overwhelming majority of Brazil's seamen remained on strike.     The statement said a meeting between Petrobras and oil industry leaders was set for next Wednesday in Rio, with the presence of Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto as a mediator.

In a report to President Corazon Aquino on his department's performance during the year ended February 28, Ongpin said at least 15.9 billion pesos were expected to accrue from new tax reform measures announced last year.     He said the goal for official development assistance (ODA) this year is two billion dlrs, adding that aid donors have committed ODA inflows of 1.7 billion dlrs in 1987, up 30 pct from 1.3 billion in 1986.     Ongpin said steps planned to provide a sound revenue base included a value added tax (VAT) system due to be introduced in 1988. He gave no other details.     He said treasury bill maturities, interest rate levels and the volume of government securities sold to the private sector have improved significantly. "In particular, short-term prime interest rates which had gone over 40 pct in 1985, are now down to less than 10 pct," he said.     Ongpin said the government's debt-equity scheme, introduced in August last year, had attracted more than 276 mln dlrs worth of applications, but selective evaluation had resulted in approvals of only 61.8 mln dlrs at end-February.     He said his department aims to accelerate its privatisation program and the sale of non-performing assets owned by associates of former President Ferdinand Marcos to achieve a 1987 sales target of four billion pesos which would help finance land reform.     Aquino said earlier this month that all the 24 billion pesos the government hopes to raise from the sale of the failed companies will be used to finance the land reform plan.     Ongpin also said the government would pursue efforts to obtain 500 mln dlrs in concessional funding for the program from a World Bank-led consultative group of multilateral and bilateral aid donors.     The government has said the land reform plan aims to distribute 9.7 mln hectares of land to poor peasants.  REUTER ;

TEST;24-MAR-1987 05:12:22.81;INDONESIAN BANKS PROFITS RISE AFTER DEVALUATION;     By Jeremy Clift, Reuters Indonesia's September devaluation helped bank profits to rise by 28.6 pct in calendar 1986, but despite higher world oil prices, banks are likely to see profits stabilise or fall in 1987, the head of Indonesia's Association of Private Banks told Reuters.     Association chairman Nyoman Muna said in an interview that most banks made windfall profits from the 31 pct devaluation against the U.S. Dollar.     He saw the outlook for 1987 as more favourable for Indonesia, with oil prices now around 18 dlrs a barrel.     But he forecast that overall bank profits would probably fall slightly from 1986 pre-tax levels, which he said were artificially high due to the devaluation.     The Association's latest report on the performance of Indonesia's 112 state, foreign and private banks shows that overall profits rose in 1986 to 495 billion rupiah from 385 billion in 1985.     This was after a fall in first half profits to 202.9 billion rupiah, from 238.1 billion in January-June 1985.     The report shows foreign bank profits slumped in 1986, mostly due to a loss by Bank of America NT and SA.     Bank of America, a branch of BankAmerica Corp <BAC.N>, was affected by a string of bad debts and other problems during the year. It showed a loss of 32.03 billion rupiah, against a loss of 3.48 billion in 1985, and 1984 profit of 7.25 billion.     A bank spokesman told Reuters he believed Bank of America in Jakarta was now back on track. "The worst is behind us."     Its assets have fallen to 194.07 billion rupiah in 1986 from 293 billion in 1985 and 301.5 billion at the end of 1984.     Indonesian profits of the 11 foreign banks allowed to operate in Jakarta fell to 6.58 billion rupiah from 39.2 billion in 1985, the report said.     These profits do not include offshore loans, which are handled through other centres but which account for most of the foreign banks' business.     Profits of Indonesia's seven key state banks, which account for more than 80 pct of domestic banking assets, rose sharply to 319.09 billion rupiah in 1986 from 212.0 billion.     Total assets of the seven rose to 40,232 billion from 31,288 billion rupiah, the report said.     Profits of BNI 1946, the largest of the seven, rose to 63.28 billion rupiah from 35.9 billion in 1985.     Its total assets expanded to 12,115 billion from 8,552 billion at the end of December 1985.     Muna said in the fiscal year starting April 1, budgeted government spending will fall in real terms. Many ministries have had budgets cut severely due to declining oil revenues.     "This will naturally have its impact on the banking sector," Muna stated. "But I think that with oil around 18 dlrs, the general performance of the banking sector will not be too bad."     Western bankers said the capital market remained sluggish, but Indonesia was using more foreign loans.     Bank of Tokyo <BTOK.T>, the only Japanese bank allowed to operate here, almost doubled its assets in 1986 to 607 billion rupiah from 335 billion in 1985, the report showed. But its profit was barely higher at 8.5 billion from 8.4 billion.     Citicorp's <CCI.N> local unit Citibank, previously listed as the largest foreign bank, slipped to second place behind Bank of Tokyo. It recorded a loss of 480 mln rupiah against a 1985 profit of 11.9 billion.     A Citibank spokesman told Reuters the loss was a book-keeping issue and did not represent the true picture, but declined to give further figures.     One western banker said that "Citibank is still definitely the largest foreign operation in Jakarta, whether or not its profit figures show it."     Bank of Tokyo and Citibank ranked 10th and 11th in terms of assets of all banks in Indonesia.

The surplus is estimated at 350 billion yen, due mainly to excess bank holdings of yen funds after heavy dollar purchases in the foreign exchange market yesterday, money traders said.     The yield on the bills for sales to banks and securities houses from money houses will be 3.9495 pct against the 3.9375 pct discount rate for one-month commercial bills and the 4.58/42 pct yield on one-month certificates of deposit today.

TEST;31-MAR-1987 13:13:29.91;TRADE WAR FEARS MAY PROMPT STOCK MARKETS' DOWNTURN;     By David Ress, Reuters The threatened trade war between the United States and Japan is just the kind of shock that economists say could send world stock markets into a tailspin.     But they are not so sure if that would be a brief corrective dip, or whether this week's falling share prices mark the start of a "bear" market.     "It's the billion dollar question," said Richard O'Brien, economist at American Express International Bank in London.     Japan's trade surplus -- 92.7 billion dlrs last year -- has poured into share and bond markets around the world, and funded a good chunk of the huge U.S. Budget deficit. Around a third of any new sale of U.S. Treasury bonds has been bought by the Japanese. However, Japanese investors have lost money as the dollar falls and will lose more if the United States lets it fall further to cut the trade deficit. The counterpart of improving the trade deficit either through a lower dollar or because the U.S. Increases duties on Japanese electronic goods, may be to hit the capital inflow which has financed the budget deficit.    And if the U.S. Trade deficit does fall, the Japanese will have less money to invest. To entice U.S. Investors to fill the gap that would be left if the Japanese stopped buying U.S. Bonds, interest rates would have to soar, O'Brien said. The subsequent shift from shares to bonds could cause major falls on the world stock markets.     "A year ago, we could be pretty confident about the markets," said O'Brien. "Now, it is much less certain."     Buoyant share prices are supposed to reflect a booming economy. But the world economy, with sluggish growth at best in the industrial nations, a massive load of Third World debt and huge trade imbalances is not in good shape, said O'Brien.     Nevertheless, New York analyst William Raferty, of Smith Barney Harris Upham said  "We're still in a bull market," adding that corrections are a normal part of a rising market and "The bear usually strikes slowly."     Economist Evelyn Brody, at Morgan Grenfell and Co in London, said the huge sums of money going through the world financial system will keep a floor under share and bond prices.     Although interest by the Japanese in putting their money in non-dollar denominated bonds and stocks has increased it's very difficult to see where else they can put their money than in U.S. Dollars and especially the U.S. Treasury (bond) market, according to David Butcher, a senior executive at Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's bond operation in London.     He said the Japanese are paying much closer attention now to the French franc and West German mark.     In the longer run, he worries about what trade tensions and the dollar's slide will mean for securities markets.  REUTER ;

TEST;13-APR-1987 05:15:39.23;TRADE ISSUES STRAINING EC'S PATIENCE WITH JAPAN;     By Gerrard Raven, Reuters Member states of the European Community are starting to run out of patience with Japan which they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open its market to imports, but as often made only minor moves.     Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the willingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanese government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC.     However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, as EC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan.     Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to an EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could raise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S. Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17.     The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligations entered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designed to stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that of the U.S.     The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC's trade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs in March, up from 1.94 billion in February.     In 1986, Japanese exports to the EC totalled 30.67 billion dlrs, up 4.5 pct from 1985, while EC exports to Japan fell one pct to 12.43 billion dlrs.     In Paris, trade minister Michel Noir said France has decided to give Japan a taste of its own medicine.     Burgeoning imports of microwave ovens and of frozen Coquilles St Jacques will be restricted by a strict application of French quality standards -- something EC states say often happens to their own exports entering Japan.     Britain has threatened to withdraw the licences of Japanese banks and insurance companies to operate in the City of London, because the British Cable and Wireless company lost out in competition for a Japanese telecommucations contract.     However, British officials in London have said that the government may have gone too far in implying that it would take immediate drastic action unless the contract was reopened.     By contrast, West Germany, with the EC's most successful economy, has never threatened Tokyo with sanctions, preferring to rely on firm diplomacy and encouragement of its own industries to surmount obstacles to export to Japan.     The EC Commission itself has switched its tactics in recent years, substituting general calls for action by Japan to open its market with specific demands for moves in key areas.     At present, it is, for instance, pressuring Japan to end allegedly discriminatory taxation of imported wines and spirits, to ensure EC companies have a chance to win contracts for the building of a new international airport, and to simplify certification and safety checks on imported cars.     EC officials say these tactics yield some benefits, but often the Japanese announce modifications of their non-tariff barriers which open the door to imports by only a token amount.     They stress, however, that any action must be taken by the EC as a whole to stop beggar-my-neighbour action.     One of the problems Britain could face if it were to withdraw licences for Japanese banks would be that the bankers would be welcomed with open arms in Frankfurt or Amsterdam, they point out.

TEST;26-FEB-1987 18:00:08.86;REPORT COULD BE FINAL BLOW FOR REGAN;     By Sue Baker, Reuters The Tower Commission's scathing    comments on President Reagan's embattled chief of staff Donald Regan could signal the death knell to his White House tenure, but the impact of its strong criticism on two other top officials was less clear.     Regan has come in for tough criticism for his handling of Reagan's worst political crisis since details of the covert arms sales to Iran and diversion of profits to Nicaraguan rebels first emerged last November.     But criticism of the roles of Secretary of State George Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, who said they opposed the Iran arms initiative yet failed to end it, had been muted until the release of the Tower Commission report.     "Their obligation was to give the president their full support and continued advice with respect to the program or, if they could not in conscience do that, to so inform the president," the report said after a three-month probe.     "Instead, they simply distanced themselves from the program. They protected the record as to their own positions on this issue. They were not energetic in attempting to protect the president from the consequences of his personal commitment to freeing the hostages."     The report saved some of its most scathing language for Regan, a gruff former Wall Street executive and close personal friend of Reagan whose autocratic rule in the White House angered some top Reagan officials and, perhaps more importantly, Reagan's wife Nancy.     "More than almost any chief of staff of recent memory, he asserted personal control over the White House staff and sought to extend this control to the national security adviser," said the report.     Washington analysts said Regan's departure now appeared to be only a matter of timing. Many expected the president to announce it when he addresses the nation on the Tower Commission's findings next week.     With Regan's departure apparently imminent and Poindexter and other key figures in the scandal already out of office, the report's tough criticism of Shultz and Weinberger could turn the spotlight on their future.     Senate Republican leader Robert Dole, a key Reagan ally, told reporters the report disclosed "colossal blunders" and said people who had not served the president well should step aside, but he did not specify who should go.     "It would seem to me that if you don't protect the president, you don't serve the president well, then you should move on," the Kansas Republican, a likely presidential candidate next year, said.     One Republican strategist said he believed Regan would not be the only White House official to leave in the near future.      Reuter ;

The FOB premium rose to 13.50 dlrs per tonne, up 2.50 dlrs from the premium for the November to April shipment, but down from 13.80 for the last May to September shipment.     Flat prices for Chinese beans are based on futures prices in Chicago plus the FOB premium.     Japanese purchases of Chinese soybeans, including spot buying, may have totalled 240,000 to 250,000 tonnes of the 1986 crop for November to April 1987 shipment, down from some 300,000 tonnes the previous year, the sources said.     Domestic demand for edible-use soybeans is expected to remain stable at about 240,000 to 250,000 tonnes a year, the sources said.     In recent years Japanese importers have overbought Chinese edible-use soybeans and sold the surplus to domestic crushers, but low 1986 U.S. Crop prices have discouraged the purchase of Chinese origin beans for crushing, they said.

Jones said all five will cost between 100 mln dlrs to 120 mln dlrs.     An analyst who wanted anonymity said 40 dlrs a share is a "decent" price for outboard. "A bdding war to 50 or 60 dlrs a share is stretching it. Maybe 45 dlrs a share tops," he said.     Outboard, which has 17 mln shares outstanding, is in registration for a two mln common share offering with Morgan Stanley Inc. It makes sense, the analyst said, for Sun Chemical to strike before the offering is underway.  Reuter ;

TEST; 5-MAR-1987 08:17:18.91;HUGHES TOOL <HT> SEEKS CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER;  Hughes Tool Co said its board has appointed a committee to search for a chief operating officer in the event that it does not complete its merger with Baker International Corp <BKO>.     Last night, Hughes directors said it would terminate its agreement to merge with Baker because Baker would only proceed if Hughes signed a consent decree with the U.S. Justice Department that the Hughes board had determined to be unreasonable.     The post of chief operating officer is now vacant at Hughes.  Chairman W.A. Kistler Jr. is chief executive officer.     Hughes said it proposed to Baker that the companies ask the Justice Department to allow them to proceed with the merger on condition that they find a buyer approved by the  Department for the domestic oilfield tricine rock bit assets of Baker's Reed subsidiary, its Singapore plant and Baker Lift's domestic electrical submersible pump business by April 22, the last date the merger of Baker and Hughes could occur under their agreement.     Hughes said its proposal would have been conditioned on it not being required to license the purchaser with any Hughes technology and on the imposition of no more adverse conditions.     Hughes said "For reasons Hughes does not fully understand, Baker declined to proceed in this fashion and insisted that it would proceed only if Hughes signed the consent decree."     The company said its board found the consent decree to be unreasonable because some "unusual terms" in the decree posed a substantial risk that control of the divestiture of Reed would be passed to a trustee owing no duties to the shareholders of the combined company, which would have been called Baker Hughes Inc, and would include all of Reed's international assets and its coring and diamond bit assets.     Hughes said the board also found unacceptable the consent decree condition that the merged company fund ongoing losses of Reed and Reed capital expenditures for as long as it took to sell Reed.     The company said the board decision to adopt its own divestiture plan and terminate the merger agreement if Baker did not accept was unanimous.  Reuter ;

Talking to journalists before a meeting of European Community Economy and Finance Ministers here, Tietmeyer declined to say whether the February 22 Paris accord by the Group of Five countries plus Canada included secret agreements for stabilising currencies.     But he noted the official communique said the participants agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange rates around current levels. "We're taking this sentence very seriously," he said.     Tietmeyer remarked that the dollar had hardly moved against the mark since the meeting.     He said a slowdown in West German economic growth had been caused by sharp exchange rate swings and that the Paris agreement should help in this respect.     Economics Ministry State Secretary Otto Schlecht said the Bonn government saw no current need for measures to bolster the economy but was paying close attention to the slower growth and had not ruled out "appropriate and timely" action if necessary.     Schlecht and Tietmeyer were speaking ahead of a discussion by the EC ministers of the latest EC Commission report on the economic situation in the 12-nation bloc.     The Commission has sharply revised down expected German gross national product growth this year to two pct from 3.2 pct predicted last autumn and says Bonn has the most room of any EC country to stimulate economic activity.     Schlecht said the upturn in West Germany's economy slowed in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of 1987. But he said there was no cumulative downwards trend in view that would make quick remedial action necessary.     He said a number of favourable indicators such as high level of investment and a good climate for consumption meant a recovery could be expected, while exports would pick up slightly during the course of the year.

TEST; 9-MAR-1987 10:32:27.75;HIGH COURT DECLINES TO HEAR APPEAL ON ATT CASE;  The Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal by U.S. West Inc <USW> challenging whether a consent decree was legally binding on the seven regional telephone firms created by the breakup of American Telephone and Telegraph Co <T>.     The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling by a U.S. Court of Appeals last August that the restrictions of the 1982 decree were legally binding on the regional companies, even though they were not parties to it.     U.S. West, one of the seven regional companies, argued that the restrictions violated the constitutional protections of due process under the law because AT and T did not adequately represent its subsidiaries during the consent decree proceedings.     The Justice Department urged the Supreme Court to reject the appeal, saying, "As a parent corporation, AT and T had the legal authority to bind (its operating subsidiaries) in a consent decree."     Also opposing the appeal was AT and T.     The appeals court ruling also allowed the Bell operating companies to offer certain services outside their territory without express permission of the federal courts.     That part of the ruling was not appealed to the Supreme Court.     Justice Antonin Scalia did not take part in today's ruling, and the court gave no explanation.  Reuter ;

TEST;11-MAR-1987 08:53:55.63;CREDITANSTALT SEES HIGHER 1987 DIVIDEND;  Creditanstalt-Bankverein <CABV.VI> is likely to raise its 1987 dividend from the 1986 payment of 12 pct of share capital, deputy general-director Guido Schmidt-Chiari said.     The 1985 dividend was 10 pct, unchanged from the previous year and Schmidt-Chiari noted that the parent bank's share capital had risen to 3.1 billion schillings at the end of 1986 from 2.7 billion a year earlier.     Schmidt-Chiari made the forecast at a news conference when the bank announced a 1986 consolidated banking group net profit of 496.7 mln schillings for 1986, against 354.5 mln in 1985.     Schmidt-Chiari did not elaborate on his dividend forecast.     The banking group's consolidated balance sheet total rose to 453.4 billion schillings at year-end from 425.4 billion.     General director Hannes Androsch said higher investment would lead to continuing growth in profits in future. Last year's better profits had resulted from improvements in services provided by the bank and also in profits on schilling lending.     Schilling lending had grown last year and interest rate margins had also improved but remained unsatisfactory when compared with those in other countries, he said.     Increased provisions for possible bad debts at home and abroad, particularly in Latin America, had lowered profits, Androsch said, but declined to give an exact figure.     Schmidt-Chiari said that foreign lending business had fallen significantly due to exchange rate fluctuations, removing some 22 billion schillings from the balance sheet total.     In an attempt to generate more foreign business, representative offices would be opened this year in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Moscow and Prague. Androsch welcomed government plans to abolish legal controls on foreigners buying voting shares and drawing dividends.     Preference shares of state-controlled Creditanstalt rose eight schillings on the Vienna Bourse today to 2,008. Brokers said improved results had been widely expected by investors.     Androsch said industrial holdings had performed better in 1986 than in previous years, giving a return on investment of 2.6 pct compared with 1.3 pct in 1985. Creditanstalt, Austria's largest bank, holds majority interests in 10 medium-sized and large Austrian companies.     But he forecast its biggest industrial subsidiary, Steyr -Daimler-Puch AG <SDPV.VI> would return a 1987 result similar to the expected 1986 operating loss of 700 mln schillings.  REUTER ;

TEST;12-MAR-1987 11:33:29.55;PORTUGAL GRAIN AGENCY BARRED FROM IMPORT TENDERS;     By Pascal Fletcher, Reuters A Portuguese court has made a preliminary ruling that the state grain buying agency EPAC should not be allowed to take part in public import tenders open to private importers, grain traders and officials said.     Under the terms of Portugal's January 1986 accession to the European Community, EC, a grain import monopoly held by EPAC (Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais) is being reduced by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990.     Private traders protested last year that EPAC was being permitted to take part in tenders open to them for the first liberalised 20 pct share of the country's annual import needs. The grain and oilseed importers association ACICO opened legal proceedings to stop EPAC participating in the public tenders.     Miguel Ascensao of ACICO told Reuters that Lisbon's civil court, in a preliminary ruling, had decided EPAC should not be allowed to take part in tenders open to private traders.     Trade sources said the ruling, though effective immediately, was subject to appeal and would have to be confirmed in further proceedings.     A member of the government Cereals Market Commission said that, as a result of the court's decision, the Commission would not be able to accept offers from EPAC in a public tender being held today for the import of 80,000 tonnes of corn.     Ascensao said the court ruling stated that EPAC's participation in the public tenders violated the clauses of Portugal's EC accession treaty dealing with the gradual dismantling of the state agency's import monopoly.     It also said the participation of EPAC, which still controls the national grain storage and distribution network, was unfair competition to the private traders.     Traders said they believed the EC's Executive Commission was unlikely to get involved in the dispute, preferring to leave the case to be resolved as an internal Portuguese issue.     "They (the EC Commission) will be keeping a low profile," one trader said.     ACICO says it is ready to take its case to Brussels if necessary.  Reuter ;

The FRN market has been suffering from acute contraction of liquidity and consequent drain of investor confidence since the effective collapse in the market for perpetual floating rate issues late last year.     Since then, FRN specialists noted that retail interest has been sparse or completely absent and the stagnant market for floating rate paper has become increasingly vulnerable to manipulation, with nerves affecting all variety of borrowers.     Floating rate debt of U.S. And Canadian banks came under pressure last month when fears resurfaced about their exposure to Latin American debt. Canadian banks were hard hit today.     Fears about the Irish economy, exacerbated by recent post-electoral political wrangling in Dublin, prompted a sell-off of Ireland paper this morning with both dollar and mark-denominated Irish issues tumbling by a full point or more.     However, FRN dealers polled by Reuters felt the Irish issues had been singled out -- as the U.S. And Canadian banks were most recently -- as the market's most vulnerable sector.     "A handful of professional houses are targetting the weak paper, shorting it aggressively and this is just starting the domino effect with basically sound paper also starting to roll with it," a senior FRN market source explained.     Although floating paper from better-regarded borrowers such as the U.K. Managed to finish the day only around 10 basis points down, other sovereigns like Sweden and supranationals like Eurofima suffered heavier losses, FRN dealers said.     Debt exposure fears continued to undermine U.S. And Canadian bank paper with one U.K. House citing a fall of 1-5/8 point on the day on a Royal Bank of Canada issue.     FRN traders noted Japanese investors, initially enthusiastic floating rate debt buyers, had lost confidence in the market and speculated that a crisis meeting, such as the one called upon the collapse of the perpetuals, could be imminent.     "Retail clients just don't want to know about the floaters any more so it has degenerated to a wily pass-the-parcel among the professionals, all scheming to sweep the paper under the carpet," another senior FRN trader said.     "I don't know what is going to happen to the market. It can't go on like this," he added.     In the fixed-rate sector, trading was dull with the market still attempting to digest a heavy volume of new issues from earlier this week although primary market activity slowed somewhat today, trading and syndicate sources reported.     Dollar straight bonds ended the day barely changed from opening levels as investors failed to react on the unexpectedly large 4.1 pct rise in U.S. February retail sales, prefering to wait for tomorrow's producer price and business inventory data.     A 100 mln dlr deal for Norsk Hydro was launched later in the day and the issue was trading around its total two pct fees at close of grey market trade although dealers said the borrower's frequent appearance in the euromarkets could deter investors.     The Canadian dollar sector however saw good two-way trade and a continuation of recent healthy volume as the Canadian dollar rides high on the foreign exchanges and futures markets.     Dealers said the strength of the Canadian dollar, which has firmed especially over the last two days, has renewed end investors confidence in the currency.     A new Canadian dollar issue for Hydro Quebec was seeing excellent demand, sector specialists said, and the issue was quickly increased to a total of 150 mln dlrs from 125 mln.     "This kind of paper can be hard to sell and it is gratifying to see such a high level of interest, both European and domestic Canadian demand," commented one trader at a Canadian house.     Eurosterling, which has been in the limelight lately, also on foreign exchange and currency bullishness, slipped slightly.     Senior eurosterling sources noted that bond prices fell back today, more or less in line with losses seen on the U.K. Government bond market -- around 5/8 point lower at the longer end of the eurosterling market.     Dealers said overseas investors had not been buying today and predicted consolidation before next week's U.K. Budget. A 55 mln stg convertible issue for confectioners Rowntree Mackintosh was well bid at 104-5/8 105-1/8 pct and expected to go well.     Euroyen bonds showed a firmer tone led by some professional short covering from Tokyo. Today's 23 billion deal for Toyota Motor Credit with a 4-1/2 pct coupon was deemed tight however.  REUTER ;

The amount was not confirmed, but the talk was widespread through the trade. Gulf cash barge basis levels jumped two to three cents this morning on the rumors, which were expected to boost futures prices on today's open.     The Soviet Union recently bought over 1.0 mln tonnes of U.S. corn, ostensibly as a conciliatory gesture ahead of trade talks with U.S. agriculture officials.

TEST;13-MAR-1987 10:53:16.93;ITALIAN BUSINESS CONCERNED OVER POLITICAL CRISIS;  Italian Prime Minister designate Giulio Andreotti expressed cautious optimism about his chances of forming a government, amid concern by industrialists that a lengthy political crisis could cause economic damage.     Andreotti today wound up his first round of political consultations aimed at finding a way out of the crisis.     His Christian Democrats and the Socialists of outgoing premier Bettino Craxi, whose row caused last week's collapse of the five-party coalition, remained deeply divided.     Andreotti said he would spend the weekend considering the situation before a second round of consultations next week.     Meanwhile Italy's top industrialists expressed concern that a long drawn-out crisis, or continuing squabbling between the five coalition partners, could jeopardise the major economic progress made in three-and-a-half stable years under Craxi.     Luigi Lucchini, president of the employers organisation Confindustria said in a speech yesterday, "What is certain is that a precarious political situation is damaging to the economy, to the objectives of companies, to competitivity."

The China Times, which has close ties with the government, quoted central bank governor Chang Chi-cheng as saying the government had agreed in principle to liberalise financial restrictions.     The bank was considering proposals to allow firms and individuals to hold foreign exchange and invest in foreign stocks for the first time, Chang was quoted as saying.     All foreign exchange must now be handed to local banks and exchanged for local currency. Firms and individuals may only invest in foreign government bonds, treasury bills and certificates of deposit.     Central bank and other government officials were not available to comment on the report.     Economists said it was likely that the government would ease foreign exchange controls, but only gradually.     They said vast foreign currency reserves, earned mainly from huge trade surpluses with the United States, made Taiwan a target for U.S. Protectionism.

TEST;17-MAR-1987 08:22:16.60;ECONOMISTS SEE SLUGGISH JAPANESE ECONOMY AHEAD;     By Kunio Inoue, Reuters The Japanese economy will remain sluggish in the months ahead after turning in its worst performance for 12 years in 1986, private economists said.     Consumer spending, a main driving force of domestic demand, was likely to remain lacklustre although brisk housing and business investment would help sustain the economy this year, the economists said.     They said they were shocked by an Economic Planning Agency report today that private spending fell 0.7 pct in the Oct/Dec quarter for the first time in 12 years.     The report said Japan's gross national product rose a real 0.8 pct in Oct/Dec after a revised 0.7 pct increase in the previous quarter.     It said GNP growth for 1986 was a real 2.5 pct, down from 4.7 pct in 1985. Agency officials said this was the worst performance since 1974 when GNP contracted 1.4 pct in the wake of the first oil crisis.     They expressed concern about the 0.7 pct decline in consumer spending in the final quarter of 1986 but said it was only temporary as exceptionally warm winter weather had depressed retail sales.     But most private economists disagreed and said consumers were likely to remain pessimistic in coming months as they saw their real income level off.     "Sure, consumers may have spent less on winter clothes or heating apparatus because of the warm winter this year, but they have done so because they have become even more uneasy about their future pay rises," said Shoji Saito, general manager of Mitsui Bank's economic research division.     He said the outlook for pay increases was gloomy because of  falling employment in many industries, particularly those hit hard by the yen's rise.     Masao Suzaki, senior economist at the Bank of Tokyo, said weakened consumer confidence was the most worrying factor. Without brisk consumer spending, Japan can hardly achieve domestically generated economic growth as the government has put a lid on fiscal measures, he said.     Other economists said the 0.8 pct growth registered in Oct/Dec may have been inflated by special factors, including exceptionally heavy spending in the public sector. Johsen Takahashi, chief economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute, said the 14.4 pct increase in public sector spending in Oct/Dec resulted from an issue of gold coins.     "This is just a one-shot spending and we can't expect that high level of public-sector consumption in the following quarter," Takahashi said. Agency officials said public spending would have risen 1.1 pct in Oct/Dec without the issue, which marked 60 years of Emperor Hirohito's reign.     Takahashi said the economy might contract in the current quarter given the lack of additional significant government spending and sluggish consumer spending.     Saito said the most effective government action would be income tax cuts and the postponement beyond next January of a proposed controversial sales tax.  REUTER ;

Some companies would be sold in their entirety and others would be privatised only partially, according to jose palomino, president of the government's state company holding firm, the national development council (conade).      He told reporters in a radio interview that the aim was to slim a projected public sector firm deficit of 11 billion intis. He did not say if foreigners would be allowed to buy all or part of the companies.     Independent economists warn that the deficit could push inflation to between 60 and 100 pct in 1987, against the govenment target of 40-50 pct.     Palomino said aeroperu, the government flagship airline with a 10-jet fleet, would issue stock for purchase by private investors. The company in 1986 registered its first profit in eight years, earning about 44.6 mln intis in pre-tax profits.     Peru has about 140 non-financial state firms. Palomino said the government would soon publish a list of those to be sold, including those whose shares would be offered on the lima stock exchange.

The sources did not give an estimate for exports in 1987, but they noted that shipments declined to 37,200 tonnes last year from 41,662 in 1985.     Low yields from the country's ageing coffee plantations and prevalence of the fungal disease Hemileia Vastatrix also contributed to the poor performance, the sources said.     They pointed out that 52 pct of Madagascar's coffee bushes were planted before 1930.     The sources said Madagascar was still a long way from reaching the production target of 110,000 tonnes per year and the export target of 63,000 tonnes outlined in the government's 1986-1990 five-year plan.     In order to reverse the decline in coffee production, the government has decided to plant 20,000 hectares with high-yielding arabica and canephora varieties, the sources said.     The planting programme will begin this year and is aimed at producing 300 to 360 kilos per hectare of beans with a low caffeine content.     The sources added that Madagascar's plan to export roasted coffee has failed to take off due to packaging problems. Only 650 tonnes of roasted coffee were exported last year.  Reuter ;

TEST;19-MAR-1987 14:52:33.51;CONGRESSMEN URGE U.S. SOYBEAN PROGRAM CHANGES;  Several leading farm-state Congressmen said they will press the U.S. Agriculture Department to implement some kind of marketing loan to make soybeans exports competitive while protecting farm income.     Speaking at a House grains subcommittee hearing, chairman Dan Glickman, D-Kan., proposed that Congressmen and representatives of soybean growers meet with USDA on the subject in the next two weeks.     "Let's see if we can try to push them (USDA) to do something without legislation," Glickman told the hearing.     The current soybean loan rate effectively is 4.56 dlrs per bushel with no income protection, or marketing loan.     David Haggard, American Soybean Association, ASA, president said USDA must make changes in the soybean program.     The current soybean program "gave us the worst of both worlds," ASA's Haggard told the hearing. The 1987 loan rate is too high relative to corn and is encouraging an expansion of soybean production in South America, he said. At the same time, the U.S. soybean loan rate is too low to provide any income support for soybean farmers, Haggard said.     "We need some kind of market loan," he added.     The 1985 farm bill provides authority for the Agriculture Secretary to implement a marketing loan for soybeans but USDA so far has resisted pressure to use the authority.     Representatives of ASA met earlier this month with USDA, but Haggard said USDA officials gave no indication if they would seriously consider offering a marketing loan.     USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz yesterday said the soybean situation is a "dilemna" which has been studied extensively by the department. But he did not say what, if any changes, are under consideration.     In his testimony, Haggard indicated there are ways other than a marketing loan which should be considered to help soybean growers, such as a so-called producer option payment, or a direct payment program.     Haggard said barring any program changes, Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC, soybean stocks, now at 385 mln bu, will rise to 500 mln by the end of August. A further 100 mln bu of soybeans could be forfeited between September and end-year.     "Thus, CCC could own the equivalent of Brazil's entire soybean crop by the end of calendar year 1987," Haggard said.     However, Haggard said that the U.S. should be cautious in making soybean program changes that might allow the European Community to challenge the U.S. program under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT.     He noted that The EC imports one quarter of U.S. soybean production and loss of that market would be devastating.     The Reagan administration has given "mixed signals" on whether it believes a marketing loan for soybeans could be successfully challenged in GATT by the EC, Haggard said.     While the ASA position is to support a 5.02 dlrs per bu loan rate combined with a marketing loan, Haggard also endorsed a proposal by Rep. Jerry Huckaby, D-La., which would set a six dlrs per bu loan rate and apply a marketing loan.     The Huckaby proposal is also supported by the ranking Republican on the House Agriculture committee, Rep. Edward Madigan of Illinois.     Subcommittee chairman Glickman endorsed the need to take some action on soybeans, but cautioned that the marketing loan could mean a substantial increase in budget costs.     Glickman noted that the Agriculture Committee must cut one to 1.5 billion dlrs from its fiscal 1988 budget and therefore must fit any soybean program changes into the overall budget.     Haggard said at a soybean loan rate of six dlrs per bu combined with a marketing loan, the U.S. soybean price might fall to four dlrs per bu initially. This would cost the government a maximum of two billion dlrs. But he said the costs would decline as market prices recovered.  Reuter ;
TEST;19-MAR-1987 18:33:06.64;U.S. SAYS NO SIGNAL BEING SENT BY SHIP MOVEMENTS;  A U.S. Navy battle group led by the U.S. aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk is in the northern Arabian Sea amid renewed concern about the safety of shipping off the coast of Iran, U.S. officials said today.     But Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoffmann said that reports the naval strike force was in the region did not mean the United States was sending a new warning to Iran against escalating attacks on shipping in the Persian Gulf.     "Nothing like that has happened," he said. "No signal is being sent."     He said that the Kitty Hawk is operating in an area where it usually does. "It's normal. It's in the waters where it's supposed to be. It's been there for over a month."     The Kitty Hawk and its force of warplanes is the mainstay of the U.S. Indian Ocean Battle Group which patrols a vast area extending from the Indian subcontinent through the Arabian Sea.     With the Kitty Hawk and its group in the Arabian Sea to the south and the U.S. Mideast Task Force in the Persian Gulf to the north, the United States has 10 warships on either end of the strategic Straits of Hormuz.     The Pentagon, as is its custom, declined to confirm the exact whereabouts of the ships or what they were up to.     State Department officials cited concern about the safety of ships passing through the Straits on the vital oil supply run to the Gulf.     Iran has conducted repeated attacks on shipping in the Gulf and U.S. officials have said that Teheran has recently equipped itself with powerful Chinese and Italian-made anti-ship missiles, posing a greater threat.

It also received a reduction, to 600,000 dlrs from 1.6 mln dlrs, of its total charter guarantee for the Regent Sea and Regent Star.

TEST;20-MAR-1987 16:57:26.14;LDC FOOD AID NEEDS DECLINE IN 1986/87 - USDA;  Total food aid needs in 69 of the least developed countries declined in 1986/87, as requirments fell in many countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     In a summary of its World Agriculture Report, the department said grain production in sub-Saharan Africa was a record high in 1986, with gains in almost every country.     However, food needs in Central America rose, worsened by drought-reduced crops and civil strife.     Record wheat production in 1986/87 is pushing global wheat consumption for food to a new high, and higher yielding varieties have been particularly effective where spring wheat is a common crop, it said.     However, may developing countries in tropical climates, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central America, are not well adapted for wheat production, and improved varieties are not the answer to rising food needs, the department said.     World per capita consumption of vegetable oil will rise in 1986/87 for the third straight year.     Soybean oil constitutes almost 30 pct of vegetable oil consumption, while palm oil is the most traded, the department said.  Reuter ;
TEST;21-MAR-1987 08:26:48.39;FORMER GOLD FIRM EXECUTIVES ARRESTED IN JAPAN;  The public prosecutors and police here arrested five former senior executives of a bankrupt gold deposit business group for defrauding about 450 clients of about 1.5 billion yen for gold bars which were never delivered, police said.     The case involving the Toyota Shoji Company was highlighted when its 32-year-old Chairman Kazuo Nagano was stabbed to death here in public view in June, 1985.     Television crews which had been waiting outside Nagano's home filmed two men smashing their way into the home and later emerging with a bloodstained bayonet.     The company, established here in 1981, undertook to hold gold on deposit for investors. It grew into a nationwide business operation with 87 branch offices and 7,000 employees at its peak in early 1985.     Toyota Shoji's business group collected an estimated 200 billion yen from about 30,000 clients, many of them pensioners and housewives, before the firm went bankrupt in July, 1985, according to lawyers.     Of them, some 18,000 clients claimed they could get back neither gold or money, suffering an aggregate loss of 150 billion yen, local press reports said.     Police said the five arrested on charge of fraud today included Hiroshi Ishikawa, 47, former Toyota Shoji president, and a sixth former executive was placed on a wanted list.     They were suspected of having collaborated with the late Nagano in swindling about 1.5 billion yen from about 450 people in Osaka and nearby Kobe during a six month period just before the firm's bankruptcy, they said.     Today's arrest came after narly two years of joint investigation by the public prosecutors and police, who had questioned about 3,000 of the firm's former employees, police sources said.

TEST;22-MAR-1987 22:08:54.94;YEUTTER SEES U.S., JAPAN VERGING ON TRADE CONFLICT;  The United States and Japan are on the brink of serious conflict on trade, especially over semiconductors, Japanese unwillingness for public bodies to buy U.S. Super-computers, and barriers to U.S. Firms seeking to participate in the eight billion dlr Kansai airport project, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said.     He was talking to reporters yesterday on the eve of a two-day meeting of trade ministers which will review progress made by committees set up after the Uruguay meeting last September launched a new round of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) talks.     European Community (EC) commissioner Willy de Clercq meanwhile told reporters conflict between the world's three major trading and economic powers -- the EC, the U.S. And Japan -- set a poor example for other members of GATT.     Australian Trade Minister John Dawkins told the reporters bilateral retaliation at the enormous expense of the rest of the world was no way to solve trade disputes.     New Zealand trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues great progress had been made in preparing for the current round of GATT negotiations which must not be sidetracked.     The ministers have said they want to maintain the momentum towards fresh negotiations or avert serious trade conflicts.     Yeutter said the problem with international trade talks was that they tended to get bogged down for years. "Countries don't get very serious about negotiating until the end of the day which is, maybe, five or six years in the future."     He also said he did not consider the new U.S. Congress as protectionist as it was 18 months ago. "That's a very healthy development," he added."If you asked me about that a year or 18 months ago I would have said that it was terribly protectionist."     "Members of Congress, that is the contemplative members of Congress, have begun to realise protectionism is not the answer to the 170 billion dlr trade deficit," Yeutter said.     "They've also begun to realise that you cannot legislate solutions to a 170 billion dollar trade deficit so they are more realistic and, in my judgement, more responsible on that issue than they were 12 or 18 months ago."     He added, "Whether that will be reflected in the legislation that eventually emerges is another matter."  REUTER ;

The committee's consideration of one of the most controversial provisions, a plan to force major trade surplus countries to cut their trade imbalance with the United States, was deferred until the full House considers the trade bill, its sponsor Rep. Richard Gephardt said.     Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, told Reuters he was not certain the exact form his trade surplus reduction proposal would take. Last year the House approved his plan to force a 10 pct surplus cutback each year for four years, by countries such as Japan.     The Ways and Means Committess' trade bill forces President Reagan to retaliate against unfair trade practices that violate international trade agreements but it allows him to wave retaliatory tariffs or quotas if the action would hurt the U.S. economy.     The trade bill gives U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter more authority in trade negotiations and in decisions to grant domestic industries import relief.     It also gives him authority to decide whether foreign trade practices are unfair and violate U.S. trading rights. These powers are currently held by President Reagan.     The administration has strongly objected to this transfer of authority from Reagan to Yeutter.     The bill also extends U.S. authority to negotiate multilateral trade agreements.

"I don't think anyone believes we'll meet the 108 billion dlr target," Lyng told the Virginia Farm Bureau.

TEST;25-MAR-1987 19:40:41.28;BAKER SAYS HE STANDS BY PARIS CURRENCY AGREEMENT;  Treasury Secretary James Baker said he stood by the Paris agreement among leading industrial nations to foster exchange rate stability around current levels.     "I would refer you to the Paris agreement which was a recognition the currencies were within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals," Baker told The Cable News Network in an interview.     "We were quite satisfied with the agreement in Paris otherwise we would not have been a party too it," he said.     Baker also noted the nations agreed in the accord to "co-operate to foster greater exchange rate stability around those levels."     He refused to comment directly on the current yen/dollar rate but said flatly that foreign exchange markets recently tended "to draw unwarranted inferences from what I say."     Baker was quoted on British Television over the weekend as saying he has no target for the U.S. currency, a statement that triggered this week's renewed decline of the dollar.     "I think the Paris agreement represents evidence that international economic policy co-ordination is alive and well," Baker said.     The Treasury Secretary stressed however it was very important for the main surplus countries to grow as fast as they could consistent with low inflation to resolve trade imbalances.     He added that Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker has also "been very outspoken" in suggesting main trading partners grow as fast as they can.     Baker noted that the J-curve, the delayed beneficial effect of a weakening of a currency on that country's trade balance, takes 12 to 18 months to work its way through to the trade deficit and it is now 18 months since the Plaza agreement to lower the dollar's value.     He also said improvements in the trade deficit should come from other sources besides the exchange rate, and pointed out the administration's package to improve U.S. Competitiveness was now before Congress.

TEST;26-MAR-1987 08:04:20.61;IWC SAYS EFFECT OF LOWER SUPPORT PRICES LIMITED;  Efforts by governments to control wheat surpluses by cutting support prices have met with only partial success, the International Wheat Council (IWC) says in its latest monthly report.     Faster results could be achieved by a policy of reducing both price and areas, as employed in the United States, the IWC says in a survey of support prices in the five main wheat exporters - Argentina, Australia, Canada, the EC and the U.S.     In some countries, for example Australia and Argentina, which are highly dependent on wheat shipments for export income, there may be problems in reducing production.     A policy of cutting wheat production could lead to unemployment, with job prospects outside agriculture limited. Alternative crops may offer inferior returns which could then lead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems.     The IWC outlines three courses of action open to governments in wheat exporting countries.     They could continue to support prices in the hope that when the world economy improves demand for wheat will rise and surpluses wil be reduced or eliminated.     Alternatively, support could be limited to wheat which could be easily sold, without needing to be stored for a long period.     This option may prove to be the most politically unattractive and would result in many producers abandoning wheat production, the report said.     The third option would be for governments to distinguish between the commercial and social aspects of agriculture, possibly varying support prices according to farm size or overall production.     The IWC review covers support prices in the major exporting countries since 1982. At some time during that period all the producers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses.     These changes did not always result in lower export subsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations more than offset lower prices in the domestic currency.     For example between 1985/86 and 1986/87 the EC intervention price for bread wheat fell from 209.30 to 179.44 European currency units (Ecus). It dollar terms, the currency in which most export transactions are denominated, the intervention price however rose to 193 dlrs from 168. The high cost of supporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequers and some governments are now searching for ways to cut expenditure, the report says.     The proportion of world wheat output produced by the five major exporters declined in the period covered by the survey from 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987. This was partly due to increased production in China and India.     The period saw an upward trend in yields, although this was countered in the Argentina, the U.S. And Australia by lower acreages.     In Argentina a reduction in the sown area of about 20 per cent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch to other enterprises, particularly livestock while lower U.S. Acreages are attributed to official incentives.

TEST;26-MAR-1987 09:13:00.01;GENERALE HEAD CALLS FOR BELGIAN BANK FLEXIBILITY;  Belgian banks will need greater flexibility to choose their sphere of operations by 1992, when the European Community is due to introduce free competition in banking throughout the bloc, Generale de Banque SA <GENB.BR> president Eric de Villegas de Clercamp told a news conference.     He said at present Belgian and Italian banks were the most restricted in the EC.     While German banks were free to hold stakes in commercial companies in which they invested capital, Belgian banks could do so only in severely limited circumstances for short periods.     "The authorities concerned should introduce within a reasonable period major modifications toward greater freedom and flexibility if we want to retain competitiveness with the neighbouring countries," de Villegas said.     He said the EC authorities envisaged that after 1992 financial institutions would be able to start operations throughout the EC.     Since the control of each institution would remain in the hands of the authorities in its country of origin, rules applied in member states could distort competition unless they were harmonised.

TEST;26-MAR-1987 12:05:59.77;BRAZIL SUGGESTS 60-DAY SHORT-TERM CREDIT EXTENSION;  Brazil today suggested to its foreign bank creditors an extension of short-term credit lines for 60 days until May 31, a spokesman for the Central Bank said.     He said that with the move, called a "standstill" arrangement, Brazil was only trying to avoid difficulties in paying its 109 billion dlrs of debt in the future.     The spokesman told Reuters that Brazil's suggestion will be communicated by telex to Brazil's 700 bank creditors. He declined to give details of the statement, but said Central Bank president Francisco Gros was seeking a 60-day extension of short-term credit lines from its commercial bank creditors.     The amount of these credit lines totals 15 billion dlrs, and deadline for payment is set for March 31.     Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said in a television interview that it was "absolutely important" for Brazil and its creditors to renew the short-term credit lines, as Brazil must finance its exports.     "If these credit lines were cut, we would face difficulties to honour our foreign debt in the future," Funaro said.     "There is evidently a common interest in the matter," he said.     Funaro said, however, he was told creditors understand Brazil's position and do not wish to make the negotiation for the renewal of the credit lines more difficult.     Funaro explained that Brazil's suggestion is part of its demands "before the need to renew the mechanisms of loans in the world."     He said that the current negotiating process is "very complex and complicated," mentioning cases of countries which had to wait some 10 months before getting a reply from creditors.     "We are not interested in confrontation, but we would like the loan mechanisms to show that the crisis belongs to both sides," Funaro said.     Funaro denied rumours that he had offered his resignation to President Jose Sarney.     "Who decides whether to keep or dismiss his ministers is the president. Everything else is nothing but speculation," he said.     Brazil last month suspended interest payments on its 68- billion dlrs of debt to commercial banks and froze short-term trade and money market lines.  REUTER ;

TEST;26-MAR-1987 14:10:59.94;BP <BP> DOES NOT PLAN TO HIKE STANDARD <SRD> BID;  British Petroleum Co Plc does not intend to raise the price of its planned 70 dlr per share offer for the publicly held 45 pct of Standard Oil Co, BP Managing Director David Simon said.     "We don't seen this as any progressive bidding game," he told reporters at a news conference. BP now owns 55 pct of Standard's stock.     Simon said BP had carefully considered the amount of its planned bid and he quoted an oil analyst, whom he would not identify, as saying BP's careful evaluation means the company is not going to raise its offer.     "I think that (an increase) would be totally wrong. I think the price is very fair and it is much to early to speculate about ligigation," he said. "Let's wait and see how the offer runs."     Another official declined to speculate under what circumstances BP might raise its bid.     The BP official said the 70 dlrs a share offer is 7.2 times Standard's 1986 cash flow and 56 pct above an independent evaluation of the company's assets, including the value of its oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves.     He said the price Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD> <SC> paid for publicly held Shell Oil Co shares in 1985 was 5.1 times cash flow.     The BP official also said the 70 dlr bid is a 40 pct premium over Standard's stock price over the past year.     BP Group Treasurer Rodney Chase said more than half to as much as two-third's of the 7.4 billion dlrs BP needs for its offer will come from existing sources. The rest will be financed by new debt.     BP will draw in cash from its operating companies around the world and is also arranging a five billion dlr line of credit, he explained.     The company's debt to equity ratio will rise 11 or 12 percentage points from the current 33 pct if the offer is completed, Chase said. But the ratio will be back below 40 pct within 12 months, he added.     Chase also said 50 to 60 pct of Standard Oil's publicly held shares are held by financial institutions.     Simon said Standard's board was informed of the offer on March nine and has been considering it since that time.     He said BP does not expect any regulatory problems that would delay completion of the acquisition. "We have informed Washington of our intentions and we've already been an integral part of ownership of U.S. oil reserves," he pointed out.     Simon said there is a good chance that current world oil prices of about 18 dlrs a barrel could be maintained, and that the more stable market is due mostly to changes in policy in Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members to control oil production.     "We think there are signals that current conditions are more favorable than they have been for sometime," Simon said.     "We have hopes for greater stability, but we do not see prices going much higher," he added.  Reuter ;

The official agency said yesterday the selected districts, still to be chosen, would have a slate of several candidates, not all of whom could be elected, and voters would strike out the names of those they did not support.     Tass said candidates would have to win support from more than 50 pct of registered constituents to win seats.     Voting is compulsory in the Soviet Union.     In the past, official returns for elections at most levels in the Soviet government system have recorded 99 to 100 pct support for all candidates. Voters simply dropped the official ballot paper with the single candidate's name into an urn.     Tass said districts chosen for the experiment would return several deputies rather than a single representative to local council bodies.     The announcement followed pledges on electoral reform by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, campaigning to revitalise confidence in the communist system after what he has described as a period of stagnation.

TEST;30-MAR-1987 07:11:22.58;JAPAN WANTS GOVERNMENTS TO BUY ITS T-BILLS;  The Finance Ministry is trying to eliminate technical obstacles so as to encourage purchases of Japanese Treasury bills by foreign governments and central banks, in order to increase overseas holdings of yen assets, a senior Finance Ministry official said.     The official declined to give details but securities sources said they expect the 16 pct withholding tax on T-bills to be repaid immediately when governments and central banks buy bills. The current practice of filing tax redemption claims is time consuming, they said.     Securities houses here have had difficulty selling six-month debt-financing paper, called tankoku, to overseas governments and central banks because of the tax system and the Bank of Japan's book entry system, which demands the accounts be kept with the houses rather than by the Bank.     Tankoku, introduced in February 1986, were designed as a key short-term instrument to promote internationalization of the yen. But since the introduction of a complicated book-entry system for bill purchases in January 1986, foreign governments and central banks have shied away from buying the bills, the sources said.     Foreign governments and central banks are therefore expected to be allowed to hold their accounts at the Bank of Japan, the securities sources said.     Relevant measures are likely to be announced at the next U.S.-Japan yen-dollar committee meeting on the deregulation of Tokyo's financial market, expected in May, they said.  REUTER ;

The bill, already passed by the House, would enable 1987 winter wheat and feedgrains farmers hit by Midwestern flooding last year to receive at least 92 pct of their federal income support payments even if they did not plant.     Amendments considered by Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.) would apply the so-called "0/92" option to all 1987 program crops or, if that failed, to spring wheat, Senate staff said.     Sens. Robert Dole (R-Kan.) and Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) were considering an amendment that would allow feedgrains producers to receive final deficiency payments in March instead of in October.     Earlier this year Dole said advancing the final deficiency payments would provide feedgrains producers with approximately three billion dlrs in income payments prior to spring planting instead of in the fall.     Dole and Grassley are also considering an amendment that would offer a two dlr per bushel bonus payment to corn farmers for any erodible cropland they enrolled in the conservation reserve program last year.     The bonus payment has been offered to farmers signing up for the corn program this spring. The U.S. Agriculture Department has indicated it would oppose broadening the corn bonus offer.     Sen.

Some analysts see crude stocks falling by as much as six mln barrels, while others think they could go up as much as 3.5 mln barrels. Crude oil runs are expected to be unchanged from the previous week or slightly higher or lower.     For the week ended March 20, the API said gasoline stocks fell 2.7 mln barrels. Mosts analysts expect a modest draw for the week ended March 27. They said stocks could fall between 700,000 and three mln barrels. Some said there is also a chance gasoline stocks will be unchanged.     API said distillate stocks dropped four mln barrels for the week ended March 20. Analysts and traders generally predict a similar or smaller depletion for last week. They said stock levels could drop 1.3 to four mln barrels.     The analysts attribute product stockdraws to seasonal factors but they said crude direction is harder to call.     Crude inventories rose 8.5 mln barrels in the week ended March 20, API said. Analysts are looking for build of between 3.5 mln barrels to a six mln barrel draw for the week ended March 27.

Boone pickens in January, Diamond Shamrock said it would spinoff its refining and marketing operation into Diamond Shamrock Refining and Marketing Co before its April 30 annual meeting.     Blackburn told Reuters, "Our advisors told us that a split would give a better share value to investors and that the market would give better multiples for pure refining and marketing and exploration and production plays."     The two companies are now in the process of organizing themselves to become "pure plays," the executives said.     Blackburn said the new company would be a pure exploration and production operation and that he was looking to divest non-oil and gas operations, particularly Diamond Shamrock's coal operations.     Blackburn said that "we are in talks about coal operations but I cannot discuss this further at this time."     He said the company would have a debt-to-capital ratio of about 38 pct, which could be paid down over time.     Blackburn said the company would seek to generate further internal savings from rationalizing operations and personnel reductions. He has set a goal of 73 mln dlrs in internal savings and "we need to get at least 20 mln dlrs of that savings in 1987," Blackburn said.     "I would rather describe this as savings coming from eliminating non-essential activities as we purify the exploration and production business."     "There are some people associated with those activities but it is more a matter of cutting and trimming rather than wholesale changes," Blackburn said.     Blackburn intends to run a tight ship in which dividends will not initially be paid and the resultant savings invested into exploration and production.     "Our goal is to find 20 mln barrels a year in the U.S. to replace our production and I think that we can do this at the level we intend to spend," Blackburn said.     "It might be more difficult to find more oil and more oil internationally at these levels," he added.     Blackburn said that his new company would spend 75 mln dlrs in North America and 90 mln dlrs overseas, mainly Indonesia, in the search for oil and gas reserves.     In 1986 Diamond Shamrock produced 82,473 mln barrels a day of oil with 83 pct of that from Indonesia, while gas output was 265.6 mln cubic feet a day of which 98 pct was in the U.S.     Blackburn said that he believed he could find oil to replace this production at low costs which were 4.97 dlrs a barrel worldwide and 3.88 dlrs a barrel in the U.S..     Blackburn also said that the company would be willing to buy reserves, "if we can find the right producing properties at the right price".     Blackburn estimated that oil prices will average about 18 dlrs a barrel this year with average prices received for natural gas at 1.57 dlrs per thousand cubic feet.     Blackburn said he currently estimates that at thee prices for its products the company will have a cash flow of about 280 mln dlrs.     "This will mean a net negative cash flow as we pretty much spend our cash flow to find more oil and gas."     Blackburn said the company will search for both oil and gas "almost exclusively in estasblished basins".     Roger Hemminghaus, who will be chairman of the new Diamond Shamrock Refining and Marketing Co, which last year had sales of approximately 1.6 billion dlrs, told Reuters his company was taking on some debt.     "We are taking on some 400 mln dlrs new debt with three tier financing emphasizing a revolving loan, some term loans and some unsecured private placement and are now in the latter stages of signing an agreement."     Chemical New York Corp <CHL> is the company's lead banker on the loan, Hemminghaus said.     That debt will set the company off at a 60 pct debt-to- capital-ratio, which Hemminghaus said "is too much. To alleviate that we will hold our capital expenditures down and pay down debt so that at the end of two years that ratio will be reduced to mid 40 pct range."     Hemminghhaus said that cash flow will be "plus or minus about 100 mln dlrs a year from earnings and depreciation."     In terms of major projects, Hemminghaus said that capital expenditures will be 35 mln dlrs to 50 mln dlrs spread over all of the company's projects.     Its major project will be a two year upgrading project on its McKee reinery in the Panhandle at 90,000 bpd rated capacity.     The company also has a refinery south of San Antonio where it will be headquartered with a capacity of 35,000 bpd.  Reuter ;

TEST; 3-APR-1987 18:07:07.20;U.S. CAR SALES RECOVER FROM JANUARY BLAHS;     By Philip Barbara, Reuters Sales of U.S.-built new cars surged during the last 10 days of March to the second highest levels of 1987, indicating that car buying may have fully rebounded from its January slump.     Sales of imports, meanwhile, fell for the first time in years, succumbing to price hikes by foreign carmakers.     For the ten-day March 21-31 period, domestic automakers sold 282,358 new cars, up 19.3 pct from late March 1986, giving the industry an annualized sales rate of 8.1 mln cars. That rate a year ago was 6.9 mln cars.     "The last 10 days of March was the second strongest 10-day period we've had this year," said David Healy at Drexel Burnham Lambert.     "We've had a slow recovery since January, and these latest figures build on that. This lends some encouragement to the idea that we're looking at a pretty strong year," he said.     In early February sales were up briefly to 8.3 mln units on an annual basis, before dropping again.     Car buyers had rushed to dealer showrooms in December to take advantage of expiring tax deductions, taking away from normal January selling.     But a slowly expanding economy, an exploding stock market and a growing array of incentives have lured customers to dealers' showrooms, analysts said.    Ford Motor Co <F> sales jumped 29.5 pct in the period to 79,249 cars from 61,169 a year ago. For the month, the nation's second largest carmaker said sales increased 17.8 pct to 197,328 compared to 167,490.     Chrysler Corp <C> reported a 20.2 pct sales jump to 40,454 compared with 33,669. In all of March it sold 96,649, up 6.3 pct from 90,945.     Industry giant General Motors's sales rose a more modest 6.2 pct for late March to 140,522 verses 132,298 last year. But sales for the full month dropped 5.6 pct to 349,578 from 370,390.     Also helping the U.S.-based industry, analysts said, is the slackening demand for imports, which suffered the first sales decline in memory.     "Imports will need more and more sales incentives, a phenomenon unheard of two years ago," said Scott Merlis at Morgan Stanley. "Import prices have risen 17 pct on average, so they've become more sensitive to weaker demand in general."     General Motors market share for the period fell to 48.2 pct, below the 51 pct for the first three months of the year and far below the 56 pct of most of last year.     Ford's market share was 28.1 pct, up from 27.7 pct for the first three months, while Chrysler's share was 14.3 pct, a rise from 13.7 pct since the start of the year.     Falling market share at General Motors apparently prompted the company to decide this week to close six plants for a week to bring supply into line with demand.     But Ronald Glantz at Montgomery Securities said further production cuts might be necessary.     "While GM has just taken 100,00 units out of second quarter production already because of weak sales, the continuation of this weakening market share suggests another production cutback is likely," Glantz said.     Other carmakers with U.S plants posted these results during the March 21 to 31 period -- American Motors Corp <AMC> 1,198, down 50 pct, Volkswagen 2,145, down from 3,342, American Honda 16,635, up from 6,358, and Nissan 4,635, up from 2,536.

TEST; 7-APR-1987 04:31:32.21;EQUITIES OPEN MIXED IN QUIET LONDON TRADING;  Share prices opened mixed in relatively quiet trading after early indications suggested a positive move forward on the back of the latest opinion polls and record closing highs on the Tokyo and Wall Street stock exchanges. At 0815 GMT the FTSE 100 index was 4.7 off at 1984.5.     Dealers said the effect of news today of two opinion polls, one of which, conducted for the television programme TV-AM, placing the Conservative party 13 points ahead of the Opposition Labour Party was offset by a belief that the market's gains yesterday may have been overdone and that a period of consolidation is due.     An opinion poll published in the Times newspaper today which measured party support in marginal seats gave the ruling Conservative Party a lead of six points over the Labour Party.     Operators said although the market is generally convinced the Conservatives will win the next general election, uncertainty over the date is continuing to provide an unsettling influence.     Among the leaders, ICI lost 2p at 1,333, Beecham 8p at 525 and Glaxo 4p at 1,484 but Wellcome lost 25p at 393 on profittaking, dealers said.     Dealers also said fears of a trade war with Japan, although less acute, remain a nagging concern in the absence of fresh developments     Unilever gained 10p to 2,560, Dixons 4p to 373, British Telecom a penny to 253 and Reuters 2p to 701.     In lower oils BP shed 6p at 914 in the wake of news yesterday that Standard Oil considered inadequate BP's 70 dlrs per share tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard that it does not already own. Shell declined 5p to 1,228.     Banks were mostly lower but showed modest declines. Barclays eased a penny to 503, as did Natwest at 588.     Standard Chartered lost 3p to 821 after recent gains on bid speculation. Press reports said Australian businessman Robert Holmes A'Court increased his stake in the company yesterday. Dealers said Lloyds bank is widely expected to renew its offer for Standard once its one-year bid limit ends in July. Lloyds rose one penny to 488.     Government bonds showed gains ranging to 3/16 point, mostly due to bullish sentiment generated by today's opinion polls, dealers said.  REUTER ;

TEST; 8-APR-1987 11:51:17.60;BRAZIL GRAIN HARVEST FACES STORAGE PROBLEMS;  Storage problems with Brazil's record grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln tonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said.     Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia, told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this year's estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost.     He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage problems.     Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes, theoretically sufficient for the crop.     But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul had between them 70 pct of the nation's capacity, but were responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.     The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage capacity.     Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation's grains production but only 20 pct of its storage space.     In addition to the poor distribution of storage units, there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for storing loose grain, Brito said.     Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the crops.     The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop has been evident from television reports, which have shown enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.  Reuter ;

They said a similar procedure was taken in the past in Brazil and that it did not work out according to plans.     "The cocoa market is completely free. Unlike coffee, which is controlled through export registrations, cocoa exporters in Brazil operate at their own free will," a trade source said.     The traders were responding to questions whether they would follow the example of CPA members meeting in Yaounde.     The sources said the Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade Department, CACEX, never interferes in the cocoa market by rejecting sales that do not meet certain price or shipment criteria.     "The position of local producers is always to negotiate as they please. If they buy for ten and sell for eleven and think it's a good deal, they are free to go ahead," one source added.  Reuter ;
TEST; 9-APR-1987 11:49:19.99;JAPAN CRITICISED FOR "DUMPING" OF BANK SERVICES;     By Rich Miller, Reuters Japan, which has been accused of dumping everything from steel to computer microchips on world markets, is now under attack for alleged cutthroat selling of a product of a different sort -- banking services.     At meetings here this week, Bank of England officials pressed their Japanese counterparts to change regulations that foreign bankers say give their Japanese rivals an unfair advantage in world financial markets.     The technical banking talks coincided with, but were separate from, discussions between Japanese officials and British corporate affairs minister Michael Howard, who left Tokyo yesterday for South Korea.     At the crux of the talks was the way regulators in various countries measure bank capital and how much capital banks must put up to back up their loans.     It is generally agreed that shareholders' equity forms the bulwark of bank capital but there is disagreement about what else should be included.     Some foreign bankers contend that their Japanese rivals can undercut them on loans and other banking services because Tokyo's capital regulations are easier to meet.     The Japanese banks have an unfair advantage, Paul Hofer, head of the Foreign Bankers Association of Japan, told Reuters.     Sumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist Masahiko Koido said, "They see us as very aggressive. We say we are just trying to catch up with them."     Earlier this year, the United States and Britain agreed to adopt common regulations requiring banks to put up capital equivalent to at least six pct of total assets. The two countries urged others to follow suit, notably Japan.     But Japanese Finance Ministry officials held out little hope that would happen soon as they just introduced new regulations governing capital ratios last May.     Under those regulations, banks have until 1990 to attain a capital ratio of four pct. But, in tacit recognition of overseas pressure, the ministry set a six pct target for Japanese banks with overseas branches.     But foreign bankers say the rub was that it allowed Japan's banks to count 70 pct of the value of their massive holdings of Japanese shares - their so-called hidden reserves - as capital.     Without the shares, big Japanese banks would only have capital ratios of around three pct. With them, their ratios are well above six pct, especially after the recent record-breaking climb of Tokyo share prices.     Western diplomats argue that the shares are valued far too high by the ministry. Japanese banks would never be able to realize anywhere near that amount if they were forced to sell the shares to raise funds in an emergency, they say.     Finance Ministry officials defended their stance by saying that studies of the stock market over the last 30 years show that prices have rarely fallen below the 70 pct value level.     But the U.S. Federal Reserve seems to think otherwise. Japanese officials say the Fed has effectively held up applications for bank licenses by Japanese financial institutions by asking them for a very detailed accounting of their hidden reserves.     The officials say Japan recently raised the issue with the Fed through its embassy in Washington and is hoping for talks on the subject.  REUTER ;

TEST; 9-APR-1987 13:14:05.13;SWISS AGREE ON NEW PROSPECTUS RULES FOR NOTES;     By Peter Conradi Swiss franc notes issued after May 1 must be provided with a prospectus, virtually erasing the difference in information requirements between notes and public bonds, according to a convention drafted by the Bankers' Federation.     The convention requires that lead managers draw up a prospectus naming all syndicate members and providing certain details about the borrower.     In contrast to public issues, though, the prospectus must merely be made available to clients on request via all syndicate banks rather than published and distributed in printed form.     The convention, which was approved by banks earlier this month, replaces an earlier convention dating from 1984 and deals with what had been widely seen as an increasingly anachronistic distinction between notes and public issues.     Its publication follows a long debate among bankers on the amount of information that should be provided by borrowers, heightened by difficulties with Swiss franc issues here on recent occasions .     It applies to all notes in units of at least 50,000 Swiss francs, the usual denomination, which are placed directly with customers by the syndicate and not quoted on the bourse.     Anything smaller than 50,000 francs will be governed by the unchanged, more demanding rules that apply to public issues.     Bankers contacted by Reuters said they did not envisage that the new requirement would present them with problems or push up fees. Many banks said that they had for some time been providing more than the legal minimum of information.     Traditionally, notes or private placements, as they were also known, were medium term instruments denominated in 50,000 francs and placed largely with institutional investors.     They were normally not brought onto the open market and never quoted on the stock exchange.     But over the years the distinction between notes and the publicly quoted and traded bonds gradually broke down. The National Bank therefore last May abolished all remaining restrictions on maturities and denominations which still formally divided them.     However, it was not in the competence of the National Bank to rule on prospectuses and banks have since continued largely as before: public issues, generally quoted on stock exchanges, have been provided with detailed prospectuses, while notes, virtually always not-quoted, have been equipped only with "information memorandums" with varying degrees of detail.     The new convention attempts to put an end to this. It says each notes prospectus must contain the following seven points:     - The precise terms of the issue     - Details of the company performance if it is more than six months since the last annual report     - Naming of all guarantors     - The source of the information     - Details of ratings, insofar as they have been made     - For equity linked notes, details of where the company's shares are listed and price high and lows over at least the last three years.     - That the lead manager has required the borrower to provide information during the lifetime of the notes on the progress of his business.      According to figures from Swiss Bank Corp, total note issues by foreign borrowers reached 18.6 billion Swiss francs last year, compared with 23.6 billion francs borrowed in the form of public bonds.     A majority of the note issues were for Japanese borrowers.  REUTER ;

The field, in the southern sector of the Gulf of Thailand, is currently operated by U.S. Oil company Texas Pacific Oil Co Inc, a unit of Canada's Seagram Co Ltd <VO.N>. Thailand's state oil company <Petroleum Authority Thailand> (PTT) also holds a major stake in the field.     PTT wants to develop the field and has asked Statoil to consider co-development if the field's licence is renewed.     PTT, according to Statoil, is currently negotiating with Texas Pacific to buy back the Dallas-based oil company's holdings in the field.     "PTT must first sort out its problems with Texas Pacific. When this is done, we have said we are interested in taking over a 30 pct share in the field," Statoil spokesman Willy Olsen told Reuters.     Statoil, hired by PTT to carry out an independent appraisal of the field's reserves and propose a development plan, has estimated the field could be commercially developed at a cost of some 700 mln crowns.     Industry sources said Texas Pacific has submitted lower reserve estimates for the field than Statoil and shown little interest in its development. Statoil refused to disclose its upgraded reserve estimate for the field.     The field's reserves could be sold domestically through Thailand's gas distribution network or by converting the gas to electricity, the sources said.     Sources would not say which field Statoil is considering.  REUTER ;
TEST;13-APR-1987 11:43:44.30;PRIMARY GILTS DEALERS NEED NOT BUY AT AUCTIONS;  Primary dealers in U.K. Government gilts will not be required to underwrite the government's offering of its securities when the first auctions begin in Mid-May, the Bank of England said.     In an official notice released today, the Bank said "There will be no formal or informal underwriting arrangement for the auctions but the Bank encourages all gilt-edged market makers, as part of their commitment to the market, to participate actively in the auction process."     The Bank was originally believed to have favoured requiring the dealers to underwrite auctions, which are patterned after those in the U.S. Treasury market.     However, the Treasury was believed to have baulked at the request by the 27 market makers for an allotment commission which would discourage the largest institutional investors from placing orders for new stock directly through the Bank of England, thus denying primary dealers some of their best customers. Commission would have been passed along to customers who did place orders via the primary dealers, making it less expensive to buy through them than to go directly to the Bank.     Market sources said the Bank had, in its discussions with the dealers about the upcoming auctions, agreed that the allotment commission was reasonable if the dealers had a concurrent commitment to buy at the auction regardless of market conditions.     Indeed, the Bank and the gilts dealers are believed to be disappointed that the Treasury has not agreed to go along with the plan. However, in its paper, the Bank suggested that any conditions applied for the first few auctions may be abandoned or modified in future sales of gilts if they prove inefficient or unwieldy.     Among other items in the document, the Bank said its first auction will consist of up to 1.25 billion stg in conventional short-dated stock and have a maturity of seven years or less.     Subsequent auctions to be held in the 1987-88 financial year would first be of up to one billion stg of long-dated stock having a maturity of 15 years or longer and then of up to one billion stg of medium dated stock of seven to 15 years in maturity.     The remainder of the gilt-edged funding program would be met by traditional tap offerings of stock via the government broker.     To protect the buyers of the newly auctioned stock, the Bank has agreed to establish a so-called fallow period, a 28-day period during which it agrees not to issue any new stock of the same type, and it will not necessarily resume selling the stock once the fallow period expires.     In the event that prices offered for the stock to be sold are substantially out of line with market conditions, the Bank will agree to take the stock onto its own books.     The bank would then be free to sell the stock during the fallow period but not at a price below the minimum tender price.     The Bank also said that at least initially, auctions will be alloted on a bid price basis, a system under which bidders are allotted stock at the price which they bid.     However, the Bank said it reserves the right to limit any money market maker from buying more than 25 pct of a single auction. The Bank is widely believed to be concerned about preventing a single market maker from cornering a stock to drive the price up.    The Bank has repeatedly signalled its intention to prevent dealers from cornering the market in a stock, issuing additional stock, on occasion, to end a market shortage.     The Bank has also agreed to publish information about the auction results as soon as possible after the sale is complete, which is widely expected to be on the same day.     Information to be released will include the amount of stock allotted in terms of both competitive and non-competitive bids, and the highest, lowest and average price of the successful bids.  REUTER ;

TEST;26-FEB-1987 18:28:33.66;FALLING SOYBEAN CRUSH RATIOS CUT OUTPUT;     by John Morrison, Reuters The sharp decline in soybean crush ratios seen in the last few weeks, accelerating in recent days, has pushed margins below the cost of production at most soybean processing plants and prompted many to cut output of soybean meal and oil.     The weekly U.S. soybean crush rate was reported by the National Soybean Processors Association this afternoon at 21.78 mln bushels, down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen over the past two months when crush margins surged to the best levels seen in over a year.     Active soymeal export loadings at the Gulf had pushed soybean futures and premiums higher, prompting a pick-up in the weekly crush number.     However, much of that export demand seems to have been met, with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surge in shipments of new crop South American soymeal over the next few months.     U.S. processors are now finding domestic livestock feed demand is very light for this time of year due to the milder than normal winter, so they steadily dropped offering prices in an attempt to find buying interest, soyproduct dealers said.     Soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recent weeks, setting a new contract low of 139.70 dlrs per ton in the nearby March contract today.     "Many speculators down here bought March soymeal and sold May, looking for no deliveries (on first notice day tomorrow, which would cause March to gain on deferreds)," one CBT crush trader said.     "But they've been bailing out this week because the March has been acting like there will be a lot delivered, if not tomorrow, then later in the month," he added.     As a result of the weakness in soymeal, the March crush ratio (The value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans) fell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 22.6 cents per bushel today, dropping over five cents in just the last two days.     The May crush ended today just over 17 cents, so no processors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitable level, the trader said. Hopefully, they will now start to cut back production to get supplies in line with demand, he added.     With futures down, processors are finding they must bid premiums for cash soybeans, further reducing crush margins.     A central Illinois processor is only making about 30 cents for every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices, down sharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and below the average cost of production, cash dealers said.     Most soybean processing plants are still in operation, with little talk of taking temporary down-time, so far. But processors will start halting production in the next few weeks it they continue to face unprofitable margins, they added.  Reuter ;

The IAC has been asked to report on the need for assistance to the industry and the nature, duration and extent of any aid, he said in a statement.     He said the inquiry will be the first step in setting marketing arrangements to apply after June 30, 1989, when the underwriting and pricing provisions of the 1984 Wheat Marketing Act expire.     Kerin said the broad-ranging reference would allow a full examination of all aspects of the wheat-marketing system.     "The inquiry will be required to take into account changes which have taken place in the industry as a result of the agricultural policies of major wheat producing countries and the industry's capacity to adjust to any recommended changes," he said.     "The inquiry is at an important time for the wheat industry, as the substantial fall in world prices is likely to trigger underwriting support from the government for the first time," he said.     Kerin was referring to the government's underwriting of the guaranteed minimum price paid to wheatgrowers by the Australian Wheat Board near the start of the season.     The IAC's report will be due at the same time as the findings of the current Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport, Kerin said.     He said the timing of the IAC inquiry would allow its findings and those of the Royal Commission to be considered in later negotiations on wheat-marketing arrangements between the federal and state governments and the industry.

TEST; 3-MAR-1987 05:07:58.30;CURRENCY SECTORS CONTINUE TO FEATURE EUROBOND TRADE;  Early dollar straight eurobond trade was quiet with currency sectors, particularly eurosterling, continuing to perform strongly, closely reflecting current trading patterns on the foreign exchanges, dealers said.     Eurosterling bonds continued to rise steadily, bolstered by the extremely ebullient tone of the U.K. Government bond market on a combination of positive U.K. Economic fundamentals.     The dollar was initially stabler but most dollar straight bonds were static in dull trade. A handful of issues showed signs of weakness but dealers said investors were awaiting today's release of U.S. Leading indicators for January.     The U.S. Data due out this afternoon is expected to be weak, placing the U.S. Unit under renewed pressure and robbing the market in dollar-denominated eurobonds of fresh trading impetus, one dollar straight trader said.     "It's going to be another tedious day and I can't see how anybody is going to make any money," he said.     Eurosterling issues continued to rally on the back of general sterling euphoria -- with the U.K. Currency trading at six month highs on interest rate optimism and the strength of the domestic equity markets.     Eurosterling bonds saw early gains of up to half a point.     However, some eurosterling dealers noted the bonds could soon fall back marginally if -- as expected -- professionals stepped in to take profits at current healthy levels.     Trade in mark-denominated bonds was expected to be subdued today due to pre-Lenten carnival festivities in West Germany.     There were signs of reawakened investor nerves affecting trade in the floating rate note market which yesterday started the week extremely quietly after a hectic sell-off last week.     FRN dealers said paper of U.S. -- and also of Canadian -- banks was seeing some pressure as a result of recent press reports focussing on their exposure to Latin American debt.     "(Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson) Funaro's visit to Europe has also brought the spotlight back onto the debt crisis after things had more or less quietened down following the first shock statements last week," one FRN specialist said.     Despite the dearth of activity in the dollar straight secondary market, two new dollar issues were the only early features on the primary market.     These were a five year 150 mln dlr deal launched by Morgan Guaranty Ltd for Saab Scania at 7-3/4 pct priced at 101-3/4 pct.     The other issue was a 100 mln dlr deal -- also due 1992 -- for NV Nederlandse Gasunie paying 7-1/4 pct and priced at 101-1/8 pct, with Citicorp Investment Bank Ltd as lead manager.     Dealers predicted reasonable demand for both issues due mainly to a lack of fresh, good name paper in the market.  REUTER ;

Ford Canada also said sharply improved fourth quarter results were due to improved cost recovery and lower product program costs, partially offset by lower engine production.     The company earlier said consolidated 1986 net income fell to 101.9 mln dlrs from year-ago 199.0 mln dlrs. Fourth quarter profit improved to 67.7 mln dlrs from 4.5 mln dlrs in the prior year.     Ford Canada said full-year earnings from its Canadian operations declined 75.4 mln dlrs to 104.0, while fourth quarter profit increased to 49.1 mln dlrs from 16.1 mln dlrs in the prior year.     Ford Canada reported a full year loss of 2.9 mln dlrs from its overseas operations, compared to a 19.6 mln dlr profit in 1985. Fourth quarter earnings from overseas operations rose to 18.6 mln dlrs from a loss of 11.6 mln dlrs in the prior year.     The company reported full-year domestic sales in Canada of 4.35 billion dlrs compared to 3.95 billion dlrs in 1985, excluding export sales to its U.S. parent.     Ford Canada said it had 1986 export sales to its parent company of 7.97 billion dlrs, up from year-earlier 7.18 billion dlrs.     The company reported 1986 overseas sales fell 205.7 mln dlrs to 2.01 billion dlrs from 2.21 billion dlrs in 1985.     The company attributed the improvement in fourth quarter results from overseas operations to manufacturing efficiencies, cost reduction programs and improved cost recovery, which were partially offset by lower industry volumes.     Ford Canada's net loss for the year from overseas operations resulted from lower industry volumes and increased interest costs, the company said.     Despite increased competition, Ford Canada's market share of car sales rose to 17.2 pct from 17.0 pct in 1985, it said. The company's share of industry truck sales rose to 29.7 pct in 1986 from year-earlier 29.2 pct.     Ford Canada said sales were boosted by its Ford Tempo car and Ford light truck, both manufactured in Oakville, which were Canada's best selling car and truck nameplates in 1986.  Reuter ;

Oil World said it was likely the Soviet Union would reduce soybean imports and step up significantly its imports of meal.     At least 500,000 tonnes of soymeal may be shipped from the European Community and South America in the January/March quarter, with additional large quantities likely to be imported in the April and July quarters from Argentina and Brazil, it said. No figures were given for imports in the corresponding periods of 1986.     The change made sense in view of the recent purchases of probably 250,000 tonnes of West European and Polish rapeseed and large scale butter imports that were expected from March onward, it said.     Oil World said substantial losses of Soviet winter grain area due to recent severe frosts were probably behind the recent pick-up in Soviet purchases of U.S. Corn.

TEST; 4-MAR-1987 15:02:15.77;CME POSTPONES RULING ON DUAL TRADING PETITION;  Chicago Mercantile Exchange, CME, directors have postponed action on a membership petition calling for a ban on dual trading, CME Chairman Jack Sandner told Reuters.     Consideration of the petition was scheduled for a regular board meeting today, but directors first wanted the opinions of a special committee that has been studying trading conditions in the Standard and Poor's 500 futures pit for the last six months.     "We didn't want to preempt the committee," Sandner said.     Instead, Sandner said the board will wait for the findings of the special S and P committee, which is considering some type of restriction on dual trading in S and P 500 futures.     Dual trading is the legal practice in which an exchange member can execute customer orders as well as trade for his own account. Critics maintain the practice provides an opportunity for traders to "front-run" or trade their own accounts at more favorable prices before customer orders are executed. Sandner said he expects the special committee to report its findings late next week and the board to act when those findings are presented.     In response to reports that the CME board is opposed to a ban on dual trading, Sandner pointed out that the board already unanimously approved a partial ban on dual trading in S and P 500 futures at a prior meeting.     The change was withheld, however, at the request of the special committee after a study was released and the committee felt the issue should be addressed more comprehensively, Sandner said.     Sandner said that he personally had no aversion to a ban on dual trading and "the leadership (of the CME) is not opposed to a ban on dual trading."     Last week, CME special counsel Leo Melamed said the special study committee is considering changes only for S and P 500 futures and options on futures.     In addition to the dual trading issue, the committee is also expected to make recommendations on the possibility for electronic order entry and execution for S and P 500 futures and rule changes to alleviate crowded conditions in the S and P trading pit, Melamed said.     Melamed said at the time that in matters where a special committee is appointed, recommendations from the committee are usually approved by the exchange board of directors.  Reuter ;

Chrysler said the plant, its sixth to undergo extensive modernization, will be shut down for model changeover starting March five.     Some 2,800 workers of the plant's 3,300 hourly employees will be temporarily laid off for 18 weeks from March five through mid-July. The other 500 workers will remain at the plant in maintenance, retooling and material handling jobs.     Chrysler said the 367 mln dlr expenditure is part of a 720 mln dlr development program at Belvidere.     The rest of the money will be spent developing Chrysler's New York and Dodge Dynasty four-door sedans to be built at the plant.     Modernization of the 22-year-old facility is part of Chrysler's five-year, 12.5 billion dlr company-wide program to bring its manufacturing operations up to current standards.     Chrysler said it will increase the number of robots at Belvidere to 244 from 41. The robots will be used in welding, material handling and sealing.

The department said the acquisition is not likely to substantially lessen competition and would not harm the public interest.     The department had given its tentative approval of the acquisition in January.     The department said it decided to make final its tentative decision after reviewing the public response to it.     The agency said it rejected an assertion by Air North America, which currently is not operating but plans to start service to some of the cities served by USAIR and PSA, that the acquisition would lessen chances of new entry into those markets by other carriers.     The agency said Air North America provided no support for its claim that the transaction would give the two carriers monopoly power in some markets.     The transportation agency said Air North America also failed to show that there are barriers that would prevent new entrants into those markets or prevent other carriers from increasing their service.

TEST; 5-MAR-1987 16:11:48.84;SHELL FRANCAISE RETURNS TO PROFIT IN 1986;  Shell Francaise <SFMF.PA>, a subsidiary of <Shell Petroleum NV>, returned to the black last year for the first time since 1982, with parent company net profit of 43 mln francs against losses of 968 mln in 1985 and 1.07 billion in 1984. In 1982 it posted a profit of 329 mln.     The company said in a statement that cash flow had improved strongly although it remained negative at 182 mln francs against 1.34 billion in 1985, due largely to improved performances by its main profit centres.     It said the results could have been even better had it not been for the collapse of refining and sales profit margins in the last quarter of the year.     In 1986 Shell sold 14.74 mln tonnes of oil products against 14.52 mln tonnes in 1985.     The company said the results were in line with its targets for the second year of its three-year recovery programme.     Meanwhile, <Societe Shell Chimie) said it also returned to profit in 1986, for the first time since 1976, posting net profit of 160 mln francs against a 1985 loss of 57 mln.

TEST; 5-MAR-1987 17:37:03.05;HOUSE 0/92 PLAN SEEN SCALED-BACK TO 1987 WHEAT;  Key members of the House Agriculture committee have agreed to scale-back the 0/92 provision of a pending disaster aid bill to cover only 1987 crop wheat, but a broader 0/92 proposal is likely to be resurrected later, Congressional sources said.     The sources said key lawmakers including Reps. Glenn English (D-Okla.), and Dan Glickman (D-Kan.) agreed to support an amendment to be offered next week by Rep. Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.) which would limit 0/92 only to producers of 1987 crop winter and spring wheat.     This would scale-back the 0/92 provision to the original proposal by English allowing a pilot 0/92 program for 1987 wheat only. That provision was later broadened by the subcommittee to include 1988 crop winter wheat.     Under 0/92, a farmer can forego planting a crop but still collect 92 pct of deficiency payments.     Earlier today, the House Agriculture committee postponed until next Tuesday a meeting to consider the disaster aid bill and 0/92.     The agreement to limit 0/92 to a wheat pilot program follows vocal criticism of the proposal by some influential farm groups who are concerned about the major impact of 0/92, and by members of Congress wary of reopening the farm bill.     Congressional sources said there has not been enough time to study the implications of a broad 0/92.     "The timing (of the proposal) is off," said one aide to a House Agriculture committee member.     However, several Congressional sources said they expect a broader 0/92 provision to emerge again when the House Agriculture committee is faced next month with the need to make spending cuts in the agriculture budget for fiscal 1988 as part of an overall deficit reduction package.     Gene Moos, aide to House Majority leader Tom Foley (D-Wash.), predicted agriculture's share of budget cuts may exceed one billion dlrs.     A broader 0/92 might be resurrected later because both the Congressional Budget Office and the Reagan administration estimate it would result in significant budget savings.     A U.S. Agriculture Department official said 0/92 for all 1987 crops would save 300 to 400 mln dlrs and more than 1.5 billion dlrs over five years.     Another factor which could affect the 0/92 debate is the approach of planting season, Congressional sources said.     Some officials said it already is late for implementation of a 0/92 in 1987 because farm program signup ends March 31 for wheat and feedgrains.     If Congress approved 0/92 later in the year sign-up either would have to be extended or reopened, sources said.  Reuter ;
TEST; 5-MAR-1987 18:36:56.08;TALKS FAIL TO END BRAZILIAN SEAMEN'S STRIKE;  Pay talks aimed at ending a week-old national seamen's strike collapsed today and the strike will continue, a union official said.     The walkout by Brazil's 40,000 seamen has idled 160 ships in various ports, Jorge Luis Leao Franco, a senior official of the National Merchant Marine Union, told Reuters.     The strikers, who are seeking a 275 pct pay increase, have rejected offers of a 100 pct raise from the state oil company Petrobras and an 80 pct increase from the National Union of Maritime Navigation Companies (Syndarma).     Leao Franco said eight hours of talks in Rio de Janeiro with Labor Minister Almir Pazzianotto ended today without resolving the dispute.     He said six ships were idle abroad -- in the Netherlands, Spain, Venezuela, France and South Africa.     Economic analysts said the strike was of major concern to the government, which has suspended interest payments on part of Brazil's foreign debt following a drastic deterioration in the country's trade balance.     The head of the National Merchant Marine Authority, Murilo Rubens Habbema, was quoted today as saying that if the strike continued foreign ships could be authorized to transport Brazilian exports.     "Brazil is living through a crisis at the moment and it is not conceivable that exports be hit," he told the Gazeta Mercantil newspaper.  Reuter ;

Faberge said the U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, reinstituted the suit against Porterfield and its partners Samuel Wyman and Grace Porterfield, vacating an earlier court decision dismissing the suit.     The suit, filed in 1982, charges Porterfield with overcharging commissions and for billing commericals that were promised but never aired, according to the company. Faberge alleges that Porterfield used fraudulent invoices and schemes which netted it more than 3,500,000 dlrs in illegal profits.     The suit, brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (RICO), was dismissed earlier because the court ruled it did not meet certain criteria of the RICO Act.

TEST; 9-MAR-1987 10:47:44.80;PAPER SAYS POINDEXTER MAY LINK REAGAN TO FUNDS;  President Reagan's denial that he knew proceeds from Iran arms sales were diverted to Nicaraguan contra rebels might be challenged by his former national security adviser, according to the Washington Post.     The paper said yesterday that John Poindexter, who resigned last November when the illegal transfer of up to 20 mln dlrs was disclosed, was ready to break the silence he has so far maintained over the affair.     The Post said he might tell a special Senate committee investigating the Iran scandal that he told Reagan twice in 1986 that money from Iran sales was being used for aid to the contras.     It said the panel was considering granting Poindexter immunity from prosecution over the fund diversion, which was illegal under a Congressional ban in force at the time against aid for the contras.     Poindexter has so far invoked the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution which protects people from giving evidence which could be self-incriminating.     Reagan has said he authorized the sale of arms to Iran in the hope of establishing links with Iranian moderates, but has denied knowing that proceeds were ending up in Nicaraguan rebel hands.     A White House spokesman had no comment on the Post story, but David Abshire, who is coordinating White House handling of the affair, said Reagan would never approve any illegal action.     Abshire, on the CBS television show "Face the Nation," did not comment directly on the Post story, but said: "He (Reagan) is deeply honest, he is deeply dedicated, he tells the truth and when he says he has no knowledge, he has no knowledge."     The Post quoted a source close to Reagan as saying the White House expected Poindexter "will say he had direction and authority, directly or indirectly," from the president for the diversion of funds.     The paper said the former security adviser's testimony could damage the president's claim he was unaware of the funds diversion.     It quoted a legal source as saying Poindexter and his lawyers planned to contend that twice in 1986 he told Reagan that the arms sales were generating money for the "contras."     The paper quoted the source as saying Poindexter did not tell Reagan there was an illegal diversion of funds, but that help for the contras was "an ancillary benefit" of the sales.     The Post's sources also said the Senate committee could grant immunity from prosecution this month to Oliver North, who was fired from the National Security Council on the same day that Poindexter resigned.

TEST;15-MAR-1987 22:04:48.36;LEADING INDUSTRIAL NATIONS TO MEET IN APRIL;     By Peter Torday Leading industrial nations will meet again next month to review their accord on currency stability, but U.S. Officials said financial markets are convinced for now the countries will live up to commitments to speed up economic growth.     The narrow currency movements of recent weeks strongly suggests the six leading industrial countries have tamed the normally unruly financial markets and next month's talks seem likely to build on that stability.     A Reagan administration official said the Paris agreement last month was the main reason markets were calm.     But he said in an interview that financial markets also understood, "That all six countries concluded that the measures to be taken over a period of time in the future should foster stability of exchange rates around current levels. That is in fact what has happened since Paris."     Monetary analysts said stability has been helped in part by the decision of industrial nations to bury the hatchet and cease to quarrel over short-term policy objectives.     Instead they have focused on medium-term policy goals, but left room to adjust their agreements with periodic meetings.     The official refused to comment, however, on whether the agreement included a secret pact to consider further coordinated interest rate cuts -- a measure industrial nations have taken jointly several times in the past year.     On February 22, the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada agreed that major currencies were within ranges broadly reflecting underlying economic conditions, given commitments by Washington to cut its budget deficit and by Toyko and Bonn to boost economic growth.     The shake-up would strengthen the U.S. Position in future international talks.     "I think these changes will strengthen the President's hand politically and the stronger he is politically the better off we are with the Congress and the better off we are in international fora," said the official, an Administration economic policymaker. "So it would be beneficial to the continued conduct of our initiatives."     But the official also said the Administration would resist calls for a tax increase to cut the budget deficit -- a target Europeans say is crucial to help curb economic instability.     Last week, dealers said the Federal Reserve intervened to stop the dollar rising against the mark, which had breached 1.86 to the dollar. British authorities are also understood to have intervened to curb sterling's strength.     International monetary sources say finance ministers and central bankers, who will review market performance and their own economic prospects, will reassemble again in Washington just before the April 9 policymaking meeting of the International Monetary Fund.     The sources said Italy, which refused to join the Paris pact, was invited back by Treasury Secretary James Baker.     Since Paris, there are signs West German growth is slowing, while U.S. Officials said they were giving Japan until April to show that an economic stimulus package was in the offing.     Signs of concern about German prospects emerged recently when Bundesbank (central bank) president Karl Otto Poehl told bankers he would consider cutting West German interest rates if the Fed was ready to follow suit.     A Reagan Administration official said this would show there had been some change in approach on the part of the central bank in Germany.     But he declined to comment on the prospects for action by the Fed and the Bundesbank.     "If there is such a provision it is private and if I talked about it, it would no longer be private," said the official, who asked not to be identified.     Public comments by Fed officials suggest the central bank is keeping credit conditions broadly unchanged, but if the major economies continue to show sluggish growth and the U.S. Trade deficit remains stubbornly high, further coordinated action could be on the April agenda.

TEST;16-MAR-1987 14:02:55.34;NEW SENATOR BACKS U.S. FARM DECOUPLING PROPOSALS;  New Nebraska Republican Senator David Karnes said he supports proposals to "decouple" farm subsidies from production decisions.     Karnes, formerly a vice president of Scoular Grain Co. in Omaha, was appointed last week to complete the term of the late Sen. Edward Zorinsky (D-Nebr.).     On target prices, Karnes said he believes the gradual reductions in supports included in the 1985 farm bill should be continued, but administration proposals for 10 pct cuts in target prices each year are "excessive."     Karnes said he opposes mandatory production controls for major crops. His predecessor, Sen. Zorinsky, had supported mandatory controls for wheat and was the author of a farm bill provision requiring a referendum on the subject last year.     Sen. Karnes accompanied Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.) to the National Grain and Feed Association (NGFA) convention earlier today and spoke to Reuters after Boschwitz addressed the NGFA meeting.     Karnes said he is seeking a seat on the Senate Agriculture Committee but no decision has been made on the request.

"It would not be sensible to provoke another dispute between Europe and the United States," Jopling said in remarks prepared for an evening speech.     "But some things are clear and they apply on both sides of the Atlantic. We cannot continue to pile up stocks while world demand shrinks," he said.     "Governments must not operate farm policies as if they were purely domestic affairs with no impact on others. They also have to recognize that they cannot in the long run develop a healthy and stable farm sector on the basis of protectionism and excessive subisdies.     "And above all, Europe and the United States have too many common interests to make it worthwhile to engage in trade wars and competitive export subsidies which end by benefitting no one." He added, "It is crucial that the United States and the European Community remain friends."     Jopling, who is a member of the EC agriculture committee, was in Indiana to visit several farms prior to talks with U.S. officials in Washington later this week.     Jopling also criticized a recent proposal still under consideration by the EC for a tax on vegetable and fish oils.     He said his government would oppose such a move because "We do not think it is correct that a shortage of funds to support (EC) farmers should be alleviated by raising money at the consumer's expense."

TEST;17-MAR-1987 07:02:02.82;LOOPHOLE FOR TANKERS IN NORWAY'S S. AFRICA BAN;  Norway's parliament has approved an extensive trade ban against South Africa but left shipowners a key loophole through which controversial oil shipments on Norwegian tankers may continue, government officials said.     The unilateral boycott gives domestic companies until late September to cut trade ties with South Africa and Namibia.     Although forbidding crude oil shipments to South Africa on Norwegian-owned tankers, the boycott makes a crucial exception for ships whose final destination is decided while at sea. As oil cargoes are often resold after loading, critics said the door will be left open for continued shipments to South Africa.     Norwegian tankers supplied South Africa with about 30 pct of its crude oil imports during the early 1980s, but the trade has dropped sharply to just one cargo in the last three months, trade ministry officials said.     The latest trade figures show Norwegian imports from South Africa dropped 36 pct to 160 mln crowns during the first eight months of 1986, while exports plunged 52 pct to 265 mln crowns from the year-ago figure.     The boycott legislation now goes to the upper house for formal ratification later this week, parliamentarians said.  REUTER ;

The Japanese press has reported that Kanemaru proposed yesterday a freeze or a modification of the value-added tax as he saw growing public opposition.

TEST;17-MAR-1987 13:27:21.92;ICCO GROUP LOOKS AT COCOA BUFFER STOCK RULE PLAN;  The International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, buffer stock working group began examining a draft proposal for buffer stock rules this afternoon, delegates said.     The plan, presented by ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn, represented a compromise between producer, European Community, EC, and other consumer views on how the buffer stock should operate, they said.     The proposal involved three key principles. First, the buffer stock manager would be open to offers for cocoa rather than using fixed posted prices as previously, delegates said.     Under an offer system, the buffer stock manager would be free to choose cocoas of varying prices, they said.     The second provision was that non-ICCO member cocoa could comprise a maximum 10 pct of the buffer stock, while the third laid out a pricing system under which the buffer stock manager would pay differentials for different grades of cocoa, to be set by a formula, the delegates said.     After the plan was presented, working group delegates met briefly in smaller groups of producers, EC consumers and all consumers to look at the proposal. Producers gave no reaction to the scheme and will respond to it when the working group meets tomorrow at 1000 GMT, producer delegates said.     Consumer members accepted the proposal as a good base to work from, one consumer delegate said.     Delegates said the proposal was only a starting point for negotiations on buffer stock rules and subject to change.  Reuter ;

Investcorp, set up in 1982, specialises in buying companies and property in industrialised nations. It then sells shares in these to investors in the Gulf region.

Gary Eder, 41, PaineWebber's highest paid broker between 1982-86, was indicted last week on charges of conspiracy and falsifying brokerage records.     Eder, who resigned from the firm earlier this year, admitted he received cash from various clients, and converted the funds to smaller amounts to avoid reporting requirements by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.     Eder said he did not profit directly from the transactions except for the commissions he received.     U.S. District Judge Edmund Palmieri scheduled May 27 for sentencing. Eder could receive up to five years in jail on each count and 260,000 dlrs in fines.     Eder had been accused of plotting with unidentified supervisors at PaineWebber to prevent the filing of currency transaction reports with the IRS. Under U.S. law, cash transactions of 10,000 dlrs or more must be reported to the IRS.     David Spears, the Federal prosecutor in charge of the case, said Eder received cash from customers in amounts up to 70,000 dlrs at one time, and then broke the cash down into amounts under 10,000 dlrs and put the money into accounts on several different days.     Outside of Court, Eder's lawyer, Milton Gould, said his client was not involved in the ongoing Wall Street insider trading scandel.

Vontobel noted that many borrowers already came to the market with ratings from the major U.S. Agencies, which were readily available to professionals through specialised information systems.     "We should make this classification obligatory and publish it in places that are easily accessible to lay people," he said. The quick changing nature of the financial market meant these ratings should also be continually updated, he said.     Vontobel also noted that recent years had seen companies, worried about takeovers, increasingly issuing registered shares and participation certificates rather than bearer shares.     However, both types of issue had a drawback, he said. The recent attempt by Jacobs Suchard AG <JACZ.Z> to take over Hero Conserven Lenzburg <HERZ.Z> had shown the limits of a 1961 pledge by the banks not to sell registered shares to someone who was not eligible according to the company's statutes.     Excessive issue of participation certificates, which do not carry voting rights, would also be contrary to the principle of greater democracy in the new share law before Parliament.     "People buying, for example, more than five pct of a company's shares should be made to declare their purchase," he said.  REUTER ;
TEST;20-MAR-1987 08:17:55.98;REAGAN SAYS U.S. NEEDS TO LESSEN OIL IMPORTS;  President Reagan said the United States must do more to lessen its reliance on imported oil.     President Reagan said during a nationally televised news conference that the rising U.S. reliance on foreign oil is a problem that the administration is studying.     "We have to study this more," Reagan said. "This is why we increased the Strategic (Petroleum) Reserve, but we have to do more," he said.     Reagan said his administration has already proposed deregulating natural gas and eliminating the windfall profits tax on crude oil production.     However, he complained that Congress had not yet approved those measures.     The Department of Energy earlier this week released a report that warned of rising U.S. reliance on foreign oil imports at a time when domestic production is declining. It suggested options for the administration to consider, but made no specific recommendations.  Reuter ;

TEST;22-MAR-1987 00:08:58.41;ECONOMIST CALLS BRAZIL DEBT REQUEST MODEST;  Brazil's attempt to seek better terms for paying off its 109 billion dlr foreign debt is responsible and modest, a former chairman of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers said.     "I think that what Brazil is calling for -- limiting its debt payments to two and one half pct of GNP -- is a responsible request on their part," economist Martin Feldstein said at a news conference.     "It requires additional money on the part of the banks, but rather modest additional amounts."     Feldstein is attending the annual meeting of the Trilateral Commission, a foreign policy group of more than 300 business and government leaders from North America, Europe and Japan.     Feldstein, one of four members of a task force on Third World debt, said that Brazil's request would mean an additional credit of three billion to four billion dlrs from banks and international agencies.     "Brazil's debt would increase in dollar terms but remain constant in real terms. The four billion dlr increase in Brazil's 100 billion dlr debt would represent no increase in the real inflation-adjusted size of its liability," he said.     Feldstein said he believed current Third World debt problems were less serious than those faced by the international monetary system in 1983 and 1985.     However, the European representative on the task force, Herve de Carmoy, chief executive international for Midland Bank PLC, disagreed.     He called the present situation more difficult and, in a draft proposal included in the task force's report, suggested setting up an institution, possibly within the World Bank, with a fund that could deal with a future debt crisis.     Commission discussions were closed to reporters but it was apparent from the news conference that task force members did not agree on all points in their report.     One point of agreement, Feldstein said, was that debtor countries would need additional credit in the coming years if they are to enjoy satisfactory growth.     Feldstein said the task force, which also included Koei Narusawa, economic adviser to the president of the Bank of Toyko, and Paul Krugman, professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, did not agree on how much credit would be needed.     He said they also did not reach a consensus on how willing international banks, particularly those in Japan and Europe, would be to lend the money.     The Trilateral Commission was set up in 1973 by David Rockefeller, former head of Chase Manhattan bank, and others to promote closer cooperation among the three regions.  REUTER ;

Pryor told the Futures Industry Association that there was great reluctance among members of the Senate Agriculture Committee to reopen the 1985 farm bill, and that a marketing loan might have a better chance in the Finance panel.     The Arkansas senator said the marketing loan -- which in effect allows producers to pay back their crop loans at the world price -- had led to a 300 pct increase in U.S. cotton exports in 14 months and a 72 pct increase in rice exports.

TEST;23-MAR-1987 14:05:33.64;BOLIVIA'S TOP UNION LEADER JOINS MINERS FAST;  Bolivia's top union leader today joined a hunger strike by 1,300 state employed miners and workers to press for higher wages he said.     Juan Lechin Oquendo, the veteran secretary general of the Bolivian Labour Organization, COB, told reporters: "I am joining the fast to abide with our call for a hunger strike".     Lechin, 83, became one of 12 COB leaders to join a hunger strike to protest against the austerity programme of the government of president Victor Paz Estenssoro.     The striking leader began his fast as leaders of 9,000 miners employed by the state corporation COMIBOL were due to star negotiations on ways to solve their conflict over pay.     About 1,300 miners and workers entered today their fourth day of fast in union offices and Roman Catholic churches to press for a substantial hike in Bolivia's minimum monthly wage, which is 40 bolivianos (about 20 dlrs), COB leader Walter Degadillo said.     "I will take part in the miners' negotiations because that does not force me to suspend my fast," Lechin told reporters.     The COMIBOL miners' strike entered its fifth day to press for higher wages and more funds for the mining nationalised industry.     About 20,000 miners, or two-thirds of the working force, have been laid off through the government's decision to streamline the deficit-ridden state corporation following a collapse in the international tin price.     The government, faced with mounting social unrest against its economic policies, has called the miners' strike and fasts part of a campaign aimed at discrediting it during the visit of West German president Richard von Weizsaecker, who began a four-day visit last Friday.     "I regret not being able to attend an invitation by president Weizsaecker to a dinner tonight because I am on a hunger strike," Lechin told reporters. "I also have to orga- nise the strike."     Weizsaecker is hosting a dinner tonight for Paz Estenssoro and had invited both Lechin and Victor Lopez, the miners' federation top leader. Although lopez has not joined the fast, union sources said its unlikely he would attend the dinner.  Reuter ;

In a letter to House Banking Committee chairman Fernand St. Germain, Volcker warned that it could lead to retaliation against U.S. firms already operating in other countries.     The committee approved the legislation yesterday. They said its impact would be felt only by Japanese firms designated as primary dealers in U.S. government securities since other countries would meet the equal access rule.     "Even Japan, at which the proposal seems to be particularly aimed, has made a number of advances in opening its market to U.S. firms," Volcker said.     The legislation gives the administration six months to negotiate equal access for U.S. firms in the foreign government securities markets before the ban on foreign dealers in the U.S. would take effect.

TEST;26-MAR-1987 18:19:35.73;PIK CERTIFICATES IN EYE OF U.S. BUDGET STORM;  Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said Congress would consider limiting the use of generic commodity certificates as a means of cutting government spending.      "I suspect that as we go into some of the budget debates we're going to have on the floor, this is going to be part of it," Leahy said, referring to proposals that the U.S. Agriculture Department save money by substituting cash outlays for payment-in-kind, or PIK, certificates in price and income support programs.      "I have a feeling that the PIK program, however the cost is defined, is going to be one of the top number of areas that people are going to be looking for savings," Leahy told a hearing of the Senate Agriculture Committee.      The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the government could save 1.4 billion dlrs during fiscal years 1988-92 if it curbed the use of generic certificates by banning so-called "PIK and roll" transactions.      Several Democratic senators had harsh comments for generic certificates.      "We're trying to take care of a bad situation -- surpluses--by depressing the price. I don't see any benefits," said Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa). "I don't see any benefit in driving their prices lower, lower, lower all the time."      But Sen. Rudy Boschwitz said he supported use of certificates. "By and large I'm favorably impressed by PIK certificates. I feel they have been helpful," said Boschwitz.      As expected, officials from the General Accounting Office and the U.S. Agriculture Department indicated their estimates of the cost of PIK certificates compared to cash outlays were far apart.      The General Accounting Office, GAO, told the committee that PIK certificates increased total Commodity Credit Corp outlays through 1987 by between 107 mln and 653 mln dlrs. GAO said that increase was offset by commodity storage cost savings of beween 169 mln and 253 mln dlrs.      Pressed by the committee, GAO Senior Associate Director Brian Crowley said government spending probably was about 450 mln dlrs above what it would have been had all program payments been made in cash, not counting storage savings.      Crowley also said he thought PIK certificates had lowered the price of corn and boosted domestic consumption of corn.      Agriculture Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz told the committee that the additional costs of using PIK certificates and storage, handling and transportation costs "balance off very closely."      Amstutz said he estimated the net cost of using certificates was about one pct higher than using only cash to make program payments.      William Bailey, USDA deputy administrator for program planning, said there were "one hundred issues I find either incorrect (in the GAO report), disagree with or where their (GAO) facts are inconsistent with what's going on."      Amstutz said GAO had not given USDA the option of "providing input" into the preparation of their report "as they frequently do."      The USDA undersecretary also conceded that certificates and marketing loans had the similar effect of "putting more goods into the market," but that while the department supported certificates, it would continue to oppose a marketing loan for wheat and feedgrains because it would cost too much.

BIL said in a statement the offer is conditional on minimum acceptances totalling 30 mln shares, just under 25 pct of the 120.4 mln Progressive shares on issue.     Progressive is currently involved in a proposed merger with <Rainbow Corp Ltd>. Rainbow earlier this week raised its stake in Progressive to 52 pct. BIL opposes the Rainbow merger and analysts say BIL needs a 25 pct stake in Progressive to prevent it occurring.     The merger involves shareholders in Progressive and Rainbow both receiving shares in a new company <Astral Pacific Corp Ltd> on a one-for-one exchange basis.     The BIL bid is higher than the 4.20 dlrs BIL said it would offer when it first announced on Monday it would make a full bid for Progressive, and it follows much public debate between BIL and Rainbow.     BIL Chief Executive Paul Collins said last week that he opposes the Rainbow/Progressive merger because BIL sees Progressive shares as being worth twice as much as Rainbow's. BIL has not disclosed how many Progressive shares it holds.     Rainbow has said the merger is soundly based. Chairman Allan Hawkins said last week that BIL's actions were aimed only at dirsrupting the merger and were not in the interests of Progressive shareholders.     Both Rainbow's and Progressive's boards have approved the merger proposal. It has also been approved by the Commerce Commission, but BIL's bid is still subject to the Commission's scrutiny.     Progressive shares ended at 4.35 dlrs, Rainbow at 3.42 and BIL at 4.17 at the close of New Zealand Stock Exchange trading today.  REUTER ;

TEST;30-MAR-1987 07:25:08.41;NAKASONE SOUNDS CONCILIATORY NOTE IN CHIP DISPUTE;  Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone sounded a conciliatory note in Japan's increasingly bitter row with the United States over trade in computer microchips.     "Japan wants to resolve the issue through consultations by explaining its stance thoroughly and correcting the points that need to be corrected," he was quoted by Kyodo News Service as saying.     While expressing regret over America's decision to impose tariffs on imports of Japanese electrical goods, Nakasone said Tokyo was willing to send a high-level official to Washington to help settle the dispute.     Government officials said Japan would make a formal request next week for emergency talks and that the two sides would probably meet the week after, just days before the April 17 deadline set by Washington for the tariffs to take effect.     Tokyo is expected to propose a joint U.S./Japan investigation of American claims that Japanese companies are dumping cut-price chips in Asian markets.     On Friday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on imports of certain Japanese electronic goods in retaliation for what it sees as Tokyo's failure to live up to their bilateral chip pact.

TEST;30-MAR-1987 08:28:43.46;GREECE SCRAPS U.S. BASE CLOSURE REQUEST;  Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou has withdrawn a request to Washington to suspend operations at an American army base near Athens as a Greek-Turkish row over oil rights in the Aegean eased.     A Turkish research ship which Greece had threatened to tackle if it sailed into disputed waters in the Aegean Sea kept to Turkish territorial waters yesterday, avoiding a potential clash.     Papandreou expressed qualified optimism after briefing opposition leaders on Aegean developments early yesterday.     The Greek government later withdrew Friday's request to Washington to close down its telecommunications base at Nea Makri, north of Athens, saying that the reasons which had prompted it to make the request were no longer valid.     Under the terms of the U.S.-Greek bases accord, Greece has the right to ask for suspension of operations at times when its national interests are threatened.     The row in the Aegean erupted after Turkey said it would search for oil round three Greek islands off its coast following an announcement from Greece that it planned to drill east of Thassos island after taking control of a Canadian-led oil consortium operating in the northern Aegean.     Turkey accused Greece of breaching the 1976 Berne Agreement under which both sides agreed to preserve the status quo in the Aegean until their continental shelf dispute was settled. Athens says it considers the accord inactive.     The Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement it had received an assurance from Greece that it would not carry out oil activities outside its territorial waters. Greece declined comment on the statement.     Papandreou repeated an invitation to Turkey to take the long-standing continental shelf dispute to the International Court of Justice at The Hague.     Conservative opposition leader Constantine Mitsotakis said he had urged Papandreou to accept an offer from NATO General Secretary Lord Carrington to help resolve the row.  REUTER ;

She said she hoped more economic exchanges between Britain and the Soviet Union "will also lead to increased friendship and increased understanding."     Earlier, she told a meeting of Soviet and British businessmen that she had agreed with Ryzhkov that they would work to achieve a total volume of 2.5 billion roubles in bilateral trade by 1990.     This would entail an increase by each side of 350 to 400 mln stg over their present export levels.     "Mr Ryzhkov handed me a list of import and export opportunities which I hope you will all jump at," she told the meeting to mark the opening of new offices of the British- Soviet Chamber of Commerce.

A company spokesman said the proposals appear to have been made in today's edition of the Japanese daily Asahi by Fumio Watanabe, head of a telecommunications committee with the Federation of Economic Organisations.     However, the suggestion still recommended a merger between the two consortia tendering for contracts and would give Cable a five pct stake, more than the three pct originally proposed but less than the 20 pct it holds in its original venture, he said.     The proposal would also offer a Cable nominee a seat on the board of the merged company.     The spokesman said he believed Japan should accept applications from the two rivals for fair review.     Earlier today Cable shares firmed on market speculation that the dispute -- which is being treated by Britain's government as a test case of how open the Japanese telecommunications market is -- was near settlement.

TEST;31-MAR-1987 09:17:29.06;ECONOMISTS CUT AUSTRIAN GDP GROWTH FORECAST;  The Institute for Economic Research (WIFO) said it has cut its forecast for Austria's 1987 gross domestic product growth to a real one pct from a two pct forecast made last December.     WIFO chief Helmut Kramer told a new conference that he saw the one pct figure, which compares with 1.8 pct last year, as the upper limit of growth. The institute had made the revision due to poor prospects for Austrian exports, he added.     A collapse in sales to the Eastern European and oil producing states, combined with the effects of the dollar's fall, mean exports overall are unlikely to rise this year.     Kramer said domestic demand alone would fuel growth this year. After last year's 2.8 pct rise in real incomes, private consumption was likely to rise 2.25 pct in 1987 after 1.9 pct in 1986, despite a present trend towards higher savings.     Unemployment was likely to rise to almost six pct from 5.2 pct last year due to the slack economic activity.     Kramer said the current account was likely to run a deficit of about four billion schillings compared with a 2.6 billion surplus recorded last year. The National Bank, Austria's central bank, last month forecast the current account would be roughly in balance this year.     However, Kramer said the lower economic growth should have no notable effect on the government's attempts to cut the budget deficit. This year's aim of reducing the deficit to 4.9 pct of GDP from 5.1 pct in 1986 could still be achieved, he said.  REUTER ;

TEST; 1-APR-1987 12:27:48.50;AUSTRIAN BANKS DIVIDED OVER INTEREST RATE CUT;  Calls for a cut in Austrian interest rates have grown in recent days but bank chiefs are divided over the issue.     Karl Vak, General Director of the Zentralsparkasse und Kommerzialbank, Wien, called today for a cut of up to half a percentage point in interest rates across the board. But Hannes Androsch, head of Creditanstalt-Bankverein <CABV.VI> told Reuters he opposed a cut because it would hurt small savers.     Vak told a news conference that last January's cut in lending rates for commercial customers and for all depositors by a quarter point had been insufficient.     The January cut followed the National Bank's lowering of its discount and Lombard rates by half a point in line with a similar Bundesbank move. Prime lending rate is now 8.75 pct and deposit rates vary between 3.25 and 5.75 pct.     Yesterday Hellmuth Klauhs, head of the Genossenschaftliche Zentralbank AG, said rates could fall at least a quarter of a point, or even half a point if German rates dropped further.     Vak noted that inflation had fallen below one pct. A widening gap between Austrian rates and cheaper West German credit along with forecasts of slow Austrian economic growth this year also justified a further interest drop, he said.     Karl Pale, head of Girozentrale und Bank der oesterreichischen Sparkassen AG [GIRV.VI] has also called for lower deposit rates but said lending rates should remain unchanged at the moment. Interest margins were too small, particularly when compared with other West European countries.     But Hans Haumer, head of the Erste Oesterreichische Spar-Casse-Bank told Reuters that no cut should be made unless West German rates came down first.     Banking sources said no bank seemed ready to lower rates alone and supporters of a cut would have difficulty overcoming opposition from Creditanstalt, Austria's biggest bank.  REUTER ;

The company said the new PC's are compatible with most existing IBM PC applications.               The new computers, which mark the first major overhaul of the IBM PC line since the company entered the business in 1981, include a PC based on the Intel Corp <INTC> 80386 microprocessor, making it the most powerful IBM PC to date.     Also included is an Intel 8086 based system which IBM said is up to two and a half times as fast as its IBM PC XT model.     IBM also introduced two new versions of its PC AT system. These use an Intel 80286 chip running at 50 pct faster than the existing IBM PC AT.     The new line of PC's, which IBM calls the Personal System/2, uses 3.5 inch diskettes instead of the conventional 5.25 inch diskettes.     The company said the smaller diskettes store from two to four times more data than larger diskette, which typically handle 360 kilobytes of data.     IBM said the new PC AT's and the 80386-based PC use a new IBM-designed 32-bit data bus. This carries data internally within the PC.     The company said the new bus offers processing power up to two to three-and-a-half times the existing IBM PC AT.     IBM said the new PC's can run a new operating system, called IBM DOS Version 3.3, which is now available.     The company also said it will offer a second operating system, called IBM Operating System/2, developed jointly with Microsoft Corp <MSFT>. This will be available in stages, beginning in the first quarter of 1988.     IBM said Operating System/2 will for the first time give IBM PC users the ability to access multiple applications and very large programs and amounts of data.     IBM said said its Personal System/2 Model 30, which is an Intel 8-megahertz (MHz) 8086-based system, is now available at a list price of 1,695 dlrs each with two diskette drives and for 2,295 dlrs with one diskette and one 20-megabyte fixed disk drive. The unit weighs 17 pounds.     It said an 8087 math coprocessor that runs at the same eight MHz rate as the 8086 is available.     The company said the Personal System/2 Model 50, an Intel 10 MHz 80286-based desktop system, is now available at a cost of 3,595 dlrs.     IBM said said its Personal System/2 Model 60, which is also an Intel 10 MHz 80286-based system, is a floor-standing system available in two configurations. This system, which is scheduled for availability in the second quarter, lists at 5,295 dlrs with a 44MB fixed disk drive and 6,295 dlrs on the 70MB fixed disk drive.     The company said the Personal System/2 80 is the most powerful member of the new family of PC's, using an Intel 80386-based mocroprocessor. The floor-standing machine will be available in three configurations.     IBM said one Model 80 configuration, scheduled for July availability at a cost of 6,995 dlrs, runs at 16 MHz, contains 1MB of memory and features a 44MB fixed disk drive.     A second configuration, also scheduled for July at 8,495 dlrs each, runs at 16 MHz and has 2MB of memory and a 70MB fixed disk drive.     The company said the third Model 80 is scheduled for the fourth quarter and features IBM-designed one-megabit memory technology. Expected to cost 10,995 dlrs, it runs at 20 MHz and features 2MB of memory and a 115 MB fixed disk drive.         IBM said its Personal System/2 incorporates enhanced integrated graphics functions including significantly improved text, expanded colors up to 256 out of a palette of more than 256,000, and sharper business graphics.     The company said the Models 50, 60 and 80 Video Graphics Array supports 640 x 480 x 16 colors in graphics mode and 720 x 400 x 16 colors in text mode. It will also support the new 320 x 200 x 256 color mode.     With the addition of the new advanced graphics feature, IBM said, 1024 x 768 addressability also can be obtained.  Reuter ;

Kuroda, who will head a Japanese team going to Washington next week for emergency talks on semiconductors, told the Tokyo Shimbun that he would try his best to convince the United States of Japan's case.     Washington last week announced an imposition of tariffs on Japanese electronic products in retaliation for what it sees as Tokyo's failure to abide by the pact. Under the agreement Japan would stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and try to buy more American chips.

The probe, launched in December, triggered the resignation of some of Guinness' senior management, including Chairman Ernest Saunders.

Network said it is taking the charge due to the significant increase in accounts receivable which remain uncollected for more than 90 days after billing. It said it ultimately will collect most of those accounts.     It attributed the sales decline to a transition period for its new products and a delay in a major order.  Reuter ;

Morgan and Co Inc chairman Lewis Preston.     He said in response to a reporter's question after the bank's annual meeting that money market rates could decline further but, "I don't think the Fed is going to encourage that as long as the exchange markets are as volatile as they are."     On the other hand, he said that, barring a collapse of the dollar, he did not see rates going much higher.     He said that Morgan's recent rise in its prime lending rate was "purely a reflection of an increase in a whole spectrum of rates."     Preston reiterated earlier company forecasts that the U.S. economy should show roughly 2.5 to three pct real growth this year.     He also said that as a consequence of the dollar's decline and oil price rises, inflation would rise "moderately" to a 3.5 to four pct rate in 1987.  Reuter ;

TEST;17-APR-1987 17:16:14.83;JAPANESE TARIFFS SEEN AS WORLDWIDE WARNING;     By Robert Trautman, Reuters The tough trade sanctions President Reagan imposed on Japanese exports are not only a shot across Japan's bow but also a sign Reagan will attack unfair trade practices worldwide, U.S. officials said.     But Robert Crandall, a trade specialist at Brookings Institution, a think tank, said "a shot across their bow can often result in a shot in our stern."     He said it left the United States open to retaliation.     The U.S. officials said the 100 pct tariffs Reagan ordered on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods will also show Congress that a tough pro-trade stand can be taken under existing laws, and no new protectionist legislation is needed.     In the past year tough trade action had been taken against the European Community over corn and sorghum, Taiwan over beer and wine, South Korea over counterfeiting of copyrights, patents and trademarkets and Japan on tobacco.     White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters the tariffs - up from five pct - should be seen as a "serious signal" to other nations on the need for fair trade practices.     Reagan said he imposed the sanctions on certain computers, television sets and some hand tools because Japan did not honor an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at less than cost and to open its markets to U.S. products. The tariffs were placed on items which were available from other sources so there would be little effect on the American consumer, Fitzwater said.     Reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action - especially against Japan - to end global unfair trade practices and reverse the growing U.S. trade deficit.     The alternative was that if he did not, Congress would.     The U.S. trade gap last year was a record 169.8 billion dlrs, and continues to rise, with Japan accounting for about one-third of America's overall deficit.     But there are other two-way deficits - with Canada, West Germany, Taiwan and South Korea - and Reagan officials said the president is ready to fight them all.     Reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that "I regret that these actions are necessary," but that the health and vitality of the U.S. semiconductor industry was essential to American competitiveness in world markets.     "We cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair trading practices," Reagan added in the statement from his California vacation home at Santa Barbara.     He said the tariffs would remain in force until Japan abided by the agreement.     U.S. officials say the action today will show Congress - which is about to write a trade bill he does not like - that he already has the tools needed to fight unfair trade.     The White House aide said of the tariff action, "it wasn't done to appease Congress, but because there was an unfair trade practice."     The aide added, however, "on another plane, it was an example of how the administration uses the trade law to fight unfair practices, an that it is not necessary to make a major overall of our trade laws."     But the analyst, Crandall, said the tariff action was not in the best interests of the United States, and that negotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue.     "It's very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route," he said, "because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions in trade."     Crandall said, "the administration is doing this for its political impact across the country, and therefore its impact on Congress."     He said, "I don't think it makes a lot of sense."

Mario Fernandez, executive director of the Costa Rican coffee institute, said delegates from Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Peru, Ecuador, India, Papua New Guinea and five central american nations will participate in the two-day strategy session beginning May 4.     The main topic will be reform of what many producing countries perceive as the ICO's unfair distribution of export quotas, Fernandez said.     He said Costa Rica would press for quotas "based on the real production and export potential of each country in the past few years" and to distribute quotas based on "historic" production levels rather than recent harvests and crop estimates.

In the fiscal 1986 fourth quarter the food processor reported earnings of 40 cts a share.     Douglas also said the year's sales should exceed 1.4 billion dlrs, up from 1.27 billion dlrs the prior year.     He repeated an earlier projection that third-quarter earnings "will probably be off slightly" from last year's 40 cts a share, falling in the range of 34 cts to 36 cts a share.     Douglas said it was too early to project whether the anticipated fourth quarter performance would be "enough for us to exceed the prior year's overall earnings" of 1.53 dlrs a share.     In 1988, Douglas said Dean should experience "a 20 pct improvement in our bottom line from effects of the tax reform act alone."     President Howard Dean said in fiscal 1988 the company will derive  benefits of various dairy and frozen vegetable acquisitions from Ryan Milk to the Larsen Co.

TEST;26-FEB-1987 18:02:58.44;SWISS ECONOMY IN EXCELLENT CONDITION, OECD SAYS;  Switzerland's economy, combining low unemployment, financial stability and a large external payments surplus, is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory future, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, said.     This reflected the success of stable and relatively tight fiscal and monetary policies followed by the government, it said.     The OECD, in its annual report on Switzerland, picked out some signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick-up in inflation this year, but said these gave no cause for concern.     The study forecast a decline in Gross Domestic Product growth to 1.75 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986 and a small rise in consumer price inflation to 1.25 pct after last year's sharp fall to 0.75 pct from 3.6 pct in 1985.     But it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest increase in the workforce, leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at around one pct, the lowest in the 24-industrial nation OECD area.     Assuming an average exchange rate of 1.71 Swiss francs to the dollar this year, against 1.69 in the second half of 1986, the report forecast a 2.75 pct rise in exports and a 3.5 pct rise in imports this year after rises of 3.25 pct and 6.5 pct respectively in 1986.     The faster growth of imports compared with exports this year and last, reflecting buoyant private consumption, meant that the contribution of the foreign payments balance to GDP would shrink in both years.     But "given Switzerland's large external surplus, there should be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than GDP...Which, if only in a small way, would contribute to improving international balances," the OECD said.     Real private consumption appeared to have been unusually buoyant last year, with a 3.25 pct growth rate, after several years of relative weakness, it noted.     In 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat to a 2.25 pct growth rate, but should still outstrip overall GDP, it added.     The outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained bright into 1987, and with capacity use at near record levels last year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation in both the industry and service sectors, it said.     As a consequence, growth in machinery and equipment investment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year after vigorous growth in 1986.     But the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for tourism and the banking industry, two major service sector earners of foreign exchange.     The long-term appreciation of the Swiss Franc, and the accelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets, could lead to a loss of international market share for both, it said.     Particularly for the banks, "recent developments in international financial markets give rise to the question whether the Swiss financial system, which has shown substantial flexibility in the past, is adapting itself at the speed required ... To preserve its competitive position," it said.  REUTER ;
TEST;26-FEB-1987 18:23:47.08;AGENCY VOTES TO END LOCAL NUCLEAR PLANT VETO;  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) proposed to ease evacuation standards for nuclear plants, which could lead the way to the licensing of controversial plants in New York and New Hampshire.     The NRC voted 4-1 to offer the rule for 60 days of public comment before it reconsidered it and set emergency evacuation standards of its own.     Local authorites at the plants at Shoreham, Long Island, N.Y., and Seabrook, N.H., had refused to take part in evacuation planning, as required under existing NRC rules.     They had claimed the region was too populated for any safe evacuation plan, holding up the NRC's authority to issue full power licenses of the two multi-billon dollar plants.     A group of prominent politicians, led by New York Governor Mario Cuomo, charged at a public meeting on the proposed plan on Tuesday that NRC members were more interested in protecting the utilties'investments than protecting public safety.     An NRC spokesman said after the meeting that the agency had not yet scheduled a meeting to vote on the proposed plan.     In a statement today announcing its vote, the commission said the proposed rule change would enable the NRC to act in cases where local authorities refused to take part in emergency evacuation planning.

Currently a farmer, to be eligible for corn program benefits, must restrict his plantings of other program crops to the acreage base for that crop.     Several members of Congress from Iowa have complained that farmers who inadvertantly failed to certify that they had grown oats for their own use in the past now are being asked to halt oats production or lose corn program benefits.

TEST; 1-MAR-1987 09:41:37.88;GULF BOND, STOCK MARKETS LAG BEHIND, GIB SAYS;  Gulf money markets have grown reasonably well during the past decade, but bond and stock markets remain to a large extent fragmented and lag behind, <Gulf International Bank BSC> (GIB) said.     The bank's economist Henry Azzam said in a review of Gulf capital markets that investors have to relinquish traditional investment vehicles such as real estate, foreign currency bank accounts and precious metals.     "Greater financial sophistication is needed coupled with more diversified capital market instruments and a change in the disclosure requirements on company accounts," he said.     The GIB study reviewed capital markets under three categories -- money markets, stock and bond markets.     Azzam said Gulf states had been making greater use of short-term money market instruments and banks in the region had floated various euronotes and underwriting facilities.     "Nevertheless, bond and stock markets remain, to a large extent, fragmented and lagging behind," he said.     Most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loans and bank facilities and very few companies had made use of stock or bond issues. Only Kuwait has an official stock exchange, while other Gulf nations have yet to establish exchanges.     But with dwindling financial surpluses in the Gulf, governments are actively pursuing ways to develop capital markets and set up domestic stock exchanges, Azzam said.     He said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had "clearly had a negative impact on the development of capital markets in the region."     In addition, family firms are reluctant to go public, financial awareness among investors is still lacking and investment analysis and corporate reporting standards lack depth. A sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s prompted investors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery.     Azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in some Gulf countries and authorities' apparent reluctance to adopt financial innovations had also hampered capital markets.     He called for clearly defined laws governing incorporation of joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments.     Azzam said capital market instruments should be made available to all citizens and institutions of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Some moves had been taken in this direction, with Bahrain allowing GCC nationals to own up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies.     Azzam said Gulf money markets had received greater depth from the introduction of treasury bill offerings in Bahrain and the expansion of securities repurchase regulations in Saudi Arabia.     But he added there is "no bond market to speak of" in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman or the UAE, with the last Saudi riyal denominated bond issued in 1978.     While Bahrain plans an official stock exchange and trading in Saudi Arabia has picked up, establishment of formal exchanges in Qatar, Oman and the UAE does not appear imminent, Azzam said.  REUTER ;

Indonesia bought 162,500 tonnes of raw sugar on world markets in late 1986, the report said.     The embassy estimated Indonesia's calendar 1986 raw sugar production at 1.8 mln tonnes, against a government estimate of 1.99 mln.     It said that Indonesia's move into sugar self-sufficiency in 1984 may have been short-lived.

TEST; 2-MAR-1987 07:27:19.76;JAPAN, U.S. SET TO BEGIN HIGH-LEVEL TRADE TALKS;     By Rich Miller, Reuters Japan and the U.S. Kick off top-level trade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides are growing increasingly irritated with each other.     The talks, held annually at sub-cabinet level to review the whole gamut of U.S./Japan economic relations, will pave the way for American Secretary of State George Schultz's one day stop-over here at end-week on his way home from China.     Faced with growing Congressional protectionist pressure, the U.S. Administration is pressing Japan for speedy action to reduce its still huge trade surplus, U.S. Officials said.     "We appreciate their frustration," a senior Japanese government official said. "But we are also frustrated."     The official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last 18 months has hit Japan hard, forcing exporters to slash spending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad. That has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade, but it will, he said.     He said the U.S. Administration was ignoring the progress that has been made and instead emphasizing the problems that remain when it talks with Congress.     "It would only take five minutes to list their accomplishments," a senior U.S. Official replied.     The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on the economic structures of both countries and how they affect the bilateral trade imbalance, which last year amounted to 51.48 billion dlrs in Japan's favour.     On the following two days, the topics will range from multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to such bilateral trade problems as super computers.     The structural talks are intended to be free-wheeling discussions among senior officials. Tomorrow's topics include savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and housing, and the implications of government budget deficits.     These talks come at a particularly delicate time for the Japanese government, which is facing increasing domestic pressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy and stimulate the sagging economy by spending more.     Some U.S. Officials complained Japan has no intention of boosting domestic demand and imports, as Washington wants.     Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge U.S. Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade imbalance. That budget deficit has meant that the U.S. Is buying more imports.     Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft trade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserial trade practices. "It condemns Japan without due process," one Japanese official said.     That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-out bill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen, he said.     Japan is also not totally happy with the administration's trade bill, particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade action by the U.S., Officials said.     Nevertheless, Japanese officials said they remain in a weak bargaining position, especially with the threat of a trade bill overhanging them.     "We have no leverage," one official admitted.     As a result, Tokyo is striving to meet U.S. Complaints about its trade practices in a variety of fields, including super computers.     The U.S. Is pressing for greater access to the Japanese super computer market.     The Japanese government has sent a long questionnaire to public institutions like universities which buy the sophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting up informal bidding procedures easily understood by all potential sellers, officials said.

TEST; 2-MAR-1987 07:39:34.16;MANILA OFFICIALS SPLIT OVER DEBT STRATEGY;  A rift has occured among Philippine officials over debt talks opening tomorrow in New York with Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod accusing the chief negotiator of softening his stand to gain a quick agreement.     Monsod told Reuters Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin had decided not to insist on Manila's creditor banks pledging to fund half of a projected 1988/92 financing gap of seven billion dlrs.     "He (Ongpin) wants to finish the negotiations as fast as possible. I'm saying that's very short-sighted," Monsod said.     Monsod said any pricing agreement on rescheduling 3.6 billion dlrs of the Philippines' total foreign debt of 27.8 billion dlrs would ignore a looming 14 billion dlr net resource transfer in the same period.     Manila is seeking a spread of 5/8 percentage points over the London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR).     Monsod said,  "Right now we are saying to the banks, let's share the financing burden."     Ongpin said last month the country's consultative group of multilateral and bilateral aid donors had endorsed a growth facility to bridge the funding gap.      He said the government and the consultative group would meet annually to gauge financing needs for each year. The aid donors and commercial bank creditors would then be asked to finance any gap on a shared basis.     He told reporters on Saturday it would be unwise to try to pin the banks down on Monsod's proposed growth facility.     Ongpin acknowledged there was a dispute over tactics. "Secretary Monsod and I get along famously," he said. "She talks and I listen but I don't necessarily agree."     Monsod said a firm commitment from the banks on bridging the financing gap would have aided the government's pump-priming program and 1987/92 medium-term development plan.     She said if private sector investment continued to be held back by the fear of a balance of payments crisis and rising interest rates, the country would fail to achieve its gross national product (GNP) growth target of an average 6.5 pct over the next six years.     "If you don't get those seven billion dlrs there is no plan. How can there be a program if there is no finance?" she said, adding Ongpin's stand was not good for the economy.     "It (Ongpin's stand) is going to make it much more difficult for the economy to attain its growth targets," Monsod said.     "Considering what the Philippine negotiating team is going to press for there is absolutely no reason why they should not be able to come back (from New York) in a day," she said.     Monsod, the government's chief economic planner, stressed Manila's policy was growth before debt.     She said if the banks refused to lend the new money, the Philippines should copy Brazil's action last week in freezing all debt repayments.     "If the banks do not cooperate by lending you back some of the money that you are sending abroad, then of course you have an option," Monsod said. "You just don't send it abroad. You do a Brazil."

TEST; 2-MAR-1987 08:47:06.03;U.S. CORPORATE FINANCE - ASSET-BACK MARKET GROWS;     By John Picinich, Reuters The U.S. asset-backed debt securities market, which grew explosively last year, is broadening and investment bankers say 1987 could see a variety of issuers.     "It is interesting to note that the first two asset-backed deals of the year were done by commercial banks," said Anthony Dub, who heads First Boston Corp's asset-backed group.     BankAmerica Corp's <BAC> Bank of America unit last week issued 400 mln dlrs of securities backed by credit card receivables via sole manager First Boston. Dub said the offering sold out quickly, mostly to institutional investors.     The Bank of America offering followed a January 16 issue of 200 mln dlrs of similar debt by RepublicBank Corp's <RPT> RepublicBank Delaware unit. Goldman, Sachs and Co ran the books on that deal, with First Boston acting as co-manager.     However, Dub said the Bank of America securities were more closely related to the so-called "cars deals" that raced to market last year than were the RepublicBank securities.     "The RepublicBank issue was secured by credit card receivables. In contrast, the Bank of America deal was the first public offering of credit card receivables because we used a grantor trust vehicle," he said.     In a grantor trust, investors buy asset-backed certificates that represent a specified percentage of an undivided interest in the trust, analysts explained.     The Bank of America certificates were issued by California Credit Card Trust A, which the bank established for that single purpose, investment bankers pointed out.     The debt has an average life of 1.79 years and matures in 1992. First Boston gave the issue a 6.90 pct coupon and priced it at 99.8125 to yield 6.95 pct, or 65 basis points over comparable Treasury securities. Non-callable for life, the deal was rated AAA by both Moody's and Standard and Poor's.     Underwriters away from the syndicate said they believed the Bank of America deal was priced too aggressively. "AAA-rated auto paper was trading about 75 basis points over Treasuries when First Boston priced the deal," one said.     However, Dub said the offering sold out quickly anyway.     The First Boston executive attributed this to the deal's top-flight rating by both agencies, unlike many of last year's cars deals, which were rated by S and P alone.     "Investors receive interest only payments for the first 18 months and then interest and principal payments for the remaining five to seven months," Dub detailed.     Investment bankers pointed out that because the Bank of America deal did not pay principal for a year and a half, the issue had a longer average life than some of the cars deals that were brought to market late last year.     The collateral for the trust includes a pool of VISA credit card receivables, backed by a letter of credit. Bank of America has about four billion dlrs of credit card receivables, making it one of the biggest in the U.S., analysts said.     Last week's deal was Bank of America's second foray into the young asset-backed securities market, analysts noted.     In mid-December 1986 Bank of America sold, via California Cars Grantor Trust 1986-A, 514 mln dlrs of certificates backed by automobile receivables through Salomon Brothers Inc.     Upcoming asset-backed issues include 200 mln dlrs of notes backed by the car leases of Volvo 1986 Lease Finance Corp, a unit of Volvo Finance North America Inc, via First Boston, and 450 mln dlrs of notes secured by sales contracts of Mack Trucks Receivables Corp, a unit of Mack Trucks Inc <MACK>, via Shearson Lehmand Brothers Inc.     The asset backed market, which began in March 1985, totals an estimated 11.9 billion dlrs.  Reuter ;

TEST; 2-MAR-1987 10:44:46.86;U.K. SAYS HAS NO ROLE IN BRAZIL MORATORIUM TALKS;  U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson has told Brazil's Finance Minister Dilson Funaro that negotiations on Brazil's debt to commercial banks are a matter for the commercial banks themselves, a Treasury spokesman said.     The spokesman said the Chancellor had emphasised in talks this morning with Funaro the need for the Brazilian authorities to be able to present a convincing economic program to the country's creditors. He added an accord with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) could be a very helpful support.     Brazil on February 20 suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of its debts to commercial banks.     Lawson's attitude was interpreted by banking sources as a clear rebuff to Brazilian hopes of obtaining official cooperation in resolving its external debt crisis.     Funaro, accompanied by central bank president Francisco Gros, is on the first leg of a tour of European capitals in an attempt to explain to governments Brazil's indefinite suspension of interest payments earlier this month.     Brazil has in the past rejected a substantial role for the IMF in managing its economy, arguing that an IMF austerity program by promoting exports and dampening domestic consumption would lead to recession and threaten democracy.     Funaro and Gros last week visited Washington as part of their trip to enlist support from governments for its attempts to change the means by which developing countries finance growth.     Funaro said on Saturday in Washington that Brazil would not have suspended payment on its debt if it had received more and faster financing from international agencies.     He said earlier today that Brazil was first approaching governments before talking to the commercial banks themselves about the interest payment moratorium "because the banks have some limits.... It's a political discussion from our point of view."     Funaro said on Friday that his talks with U.S. Officials had resulted in no new financial arrangement to help resolve Brazil's debt crisis, describing the meeting as an initial contact.     He had earlier met Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker and U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker.     The Treasury spokesman pointed out that today's talks had been at Funaro's request.     After travelling this week to France, Germany, Switzerland and Italy, Funaro hopes to visit Canada and Japan next week before starting negotiations with banks.  REUTER ;

TEST; 2-MAR-1987 11:23:31.27;REDSTONE DETAILS SWEETENED VIACOM <VIA> OFFER;  Investor Sumner Redstone, who leads one of the two groups vying for control of Viacom International Inc, offered to sweeten his bid for the company by 1.50 dlrs a share cash and 1.50 dlrs in securities.     In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Redstone, who controls Dedham, Mass.,-based National Amusements Inc, a theater chain operator, offered to raise the cash portion of its Viacom offer to 42 dlrs a share from 40.50 dlrs.     Redstone also raised the face value of the preferred stock he is offering to 7.50 dlrs from six dlrs.     The Redstone offer, which is being made through Arsenal Holdings Inc, a National Amusements subsidiary set up for that purpose, which also give Viacom shareholders one-fifth of a share of Arsenal common stock after the takeover.     Viacom said earlier today it received revised takeover bids from Redstone and MCV Holdings Inc, a group led by Viacom management which is competing with Redstone for control of the company and already has a formal merger agreement with Viacom.     The company did not disclose the details of the revised offers, but said a special committee of its board would review them later today.     The Redstone group, which has a 19.5 pct stake in Viacom, and the management group, which has a 5.4 pct stake, have both agreed not to buy more shares of the company until a merger is completed, unless the purchases are part of a tender offer for at least half of the outstanding stock.     The two rivals also signed confidentiality agreements, which give them access to Viacom's financial records provided they keep the information secret.     In his SEC filing, Redstone, who estimated his cost of completing the takeover at 2.95 billion dlrs, said Bank of America is confident it can raise 2.275 billion dlrs.     Besides the financing it would raise through a bank syndicate, Bank of America has also agreed to provide a separate 25 mln dlr for the limited purpose of partial financing and has committed to provide another 592 mln dlrs, Redstone said.     Merrill Lynch, Pierce Fenner and Smith Inc has increased its underwriting commitment to 175 mln dlrs of subordinated financing debt for the Viacom takeover, from the 150 mln dlrs it agreed to underwrite earlier, Redstone said.     Redstone said his group would contribute more than 475 mln dlrs in equity toward the takeover.     The Redstone equity contribution to the takeover would consist of all of his group's 6,881,800 Viacom common shares and at least 118 mln dlrs cash, he said.     The new offer, the second sweetened deal Redstone has proposed in his month-long bidding war with management, also contains newly drawn up proposed merger documents, he said.     Last week, the management group submitted what it called its last offer for the company, valued at 3.1 mln dlrs and consisting of 38.50 dlrs a share cash, preferred stock valued at eight dlrs a share and equity in the new company. Redstone's previous offer had been valued at 3.2 billion dlrs.  Reuter ;

The system, designed to give market participants a fast and reliable way of checking whether transactions are matched, will initially cover reporting of confirmed and mismatched trades.     It will include recording additional trade data, checking, comparison and matching any new elements but will only apply initially to delivery against payment transactions, AIBD said.     The AIBD said in a statement it would be responsible for developing suitable rules to back up the two clearing systems when they introduce their new matching matching facilities and confirmation systems by September this year.     Euroclear and Cedel intend to bring a "trade date-plus-one" matching capacity, reporting on a given day on trades entered by 1000 London time, designed to work with a planned AIBD rule requiring the entry of previous day's trades by that time.     The confirmation system covering critical trade data is designed to aid the trader and the settlements department and also reduce trading risks in volatile markets, AIBD said.  Reuter ;

TEST; 2-MAR-1987 13:11:47.94;OPEC PRESIDENT SAYS OIL MARKET BEING MANIPULATED;  OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman accused "oil market manipulators" of drawing down their own stocks and spreading rumours to give the impression OPEC was breaking its 15.8 mln barrels per day output ceiling, set last December.     Lukman told reporters the aim was to pull prices below the 18 dlrs per barrel reference level set by OPEC.     "People are playing a waiting game to test the will of OPEC by drawing down more on their stock than normal, and this is having the effect of giving an apparent excess supply on the market which we know is not real," Lukman said.     Lukman, Nigeria's oil minister, said that despite probable "minor deviations" by one or two member countries, "basically OPEC is producing around what it said it would produce."     After OPEC's price and production accord last December, the market firmed steadily but spot prices fell in the last week to around 16 dlrs. Industry reports estimated the organization was producing up to one mln bpd above its ceiling during February.     But Lukman was confident OPEC would maintain its discipline, in view of past experience. "We have the experience of what happened in 1986 behind us, when violations of agreements led to the collapse of the market," he said.     Lukman was in Kingston as a guest of the state-owned Petroleum Corp of Jamaica.  REUTER ;

TEST; 2-MAR-1987 18:42:36.99;CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTING DOWN THREE PCT IN JAN;  Contracting for future construction work declined by three pct in January to an annualized rate of 236.1 billion dlrs, a report on the industry said.     The report by the F.W. Dodge Division of McGraw-Hill Information Systems Co said a 10 pct reversal of nonbuilding construction was largely responsible for the month's setback from December's higher level.     Residential building eased three pct in January, while contracts for commercial, industrial and institutional buildings rebounded slightly, according to the report.     Nonbuilding construction, which soared to an annualized rate of 47.8 billion dlrs in December when last year's only major electric power plant was started, fell back 10 pct to 43.1 billion.     Dodge said contracting for highway and bridge construction advanced five pct in January. However, available funding for 1987 construction could dry up if Congress fails to act after the Federal highway program runs out of carryover spending authority.     Nonresidential buildings edged up one pct in January to an annualized rate of 77.6 billion. Contracting for institutional structures, such as schools and health facilities, was the reason for the gain, the report said.     Residential building was valued at 115.4 billion dlrs in January, a decrease of three pct from December's seasonally adjusted rate, the report stated. However, demand will be strong for single-family units supported by falling mortgage rates, but multi-family buildings will not be in high demand as a result of the tax reform, according to the report.

The major target of the Japanese government is to maintain the yen at above 150, at least for the rest of the year," he told reporters during a brief visit to Malaysia.

TEST; 3-MAR-1987 00:14:40.28;EARTHQUAKES CONTINUE TO SHAKE NORTHERN NEW ZEALAND;  Earthquakes and aftershocks are still shaking areas of northern New Zealand following yesterday's strong tremor which left 3,000 people homeless.     Four earthquakes measuring up to 4.5 on the Richter scale have hit the Bay of Plenty and Waikato region in the north-east since midnight yesterday (1200 GMT).     No casualties have been reported and no further major damage, civil defence sources said. Twenty-five people were treated for bone fractures after yesterday's shock.     A government seismologist said from Rotorua in the North Island some five tremors were being recorded every 10 minutes.     Today's quakes were felt over an area of 100 square km, the seismologist added.     A state of civil defence emergency in the area was declared yesterday and is still in force, with schools closed and access to the worst-hit towns of Edgecumbe, Whakatane and the forestry town of Kawerau severely restricted.     Yesterday's quake measured 6.25 on the Richter scale.     The seismologist said if the pattern of other large earthquakes was followed the shocks would continue for one to several weeks, declining in frequency and magnitude. But the chance of a further large shock could not be ruled out.     Civil defence officials said major roadslips and landslides in the area are being cleared, with power and water restored to most areas. Rail lines twisted by earth movements are being repaired.

TEST; 3-MAR-1987 03:42:10.69;BANKERS SEE SHARP RISE IN THAI FOREIGN RESERVES;  Thailand's improving economy will likely cause foreign reserves to increase to at least five billion dlrs by end-1987 from a record of nearly 4.2 billion at end-February, private bankers said.     Bank of Thailand statistics show foreign reserves rose to 3.95 billion at end-January from 3.03 billion a year earlier.     Nimit Nonthapanthawat, chief economist at the <Bangkok Bank Ltd>, said Thailand's strong export performance, its relatively high interest rates, foreign participation in its stock market, and growing foreign investment, especially from Japan, contributed to the projected sharp rise.     Thai exports rose 19.4 pct in 1986 and are expected to expand another 15 pct this year, bankers said.     A U.S. Embassy report said last month Thailand could achieve five pct real gross domestic product growth in 1987, up from a projection of 3.8 pct for 1986 and 3.7 pct in 1985.     Nonthapanthawat said if economic growth continues at its current pace and oil prices and major currencies remain stable the five billion 1987 reserves target can easily be reached.     Thailand calculates foreign reserves to include gold, special drawing rights and convertible currencies. The target is equivalent to five-and-a-half months' worth of imports.  REUTER ;

Very good progress was made last year, while the recent acquisition of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc <CBM.N> was a significant addition which will greatly benefit the group in the years to come.     Earlier, Unilever reported combined fourth quarter pre-tax profit of 276 mln stg, level with the year earlier period, making 1.14 billion stg compared with 953 mln for the 1986 full year.     Unilever said it plans to change its depreciation policy to the more conventional practice of depreciating assets individually rather than depreciating fixed assets at average rates. The new method is expected to lead to a reduction in the accumulated provision for depreciation and thereby increase the net book value of tangible asssets by about 300 mln stg as at January 1, 1987.

TEST; 3-MAR-1987 10:12:44.89;KODAK <EK> HAS NEW DATA STORAGE, USAGE SYSTEMS;  Eastman Kodak Co said it is introducing four information technology systems that will be led by today's highest-capacity system for data storage and retrieval.     The company said information management products will be the focus of a multi-mln dlr business-to-business communications campaign under the threme "The New Vision of Kodak."     Noting that it is well-known as a photographic company, Kodak said its information technology sales exceeded four billion dlrs in 1986. "If the Kodak divisions generating those sales were independent, that company would rank among the top 100 of the Fortune 500," it pointed out.     The objective of Kodak's "new vision" communications campaign, it added, is to inform others of the company's commitment to the business and industrial sector.     Kodak said the campaign will focus in part on the information management systems unveilded today --     -- The Kodak optical disk system 6800 which can store more than a terabyte of information (a tillion bytes).     - The Kodak KIMS system 5000, a networked information management system using optical disks or microfilm or both.     -- The Kodak KIMS system 3000, an optical-disk-based system that allows users to integrate optical disks into their current information management systems.     -- The Kodak KIMS system 4500, a microfilm-based, computer-assisted system which can be a starter system.     Kodak said the optical disy system 6800 is a write-once/ready-many-times type its Mass Memory Division will market on a limited basis later this year and in quantity in 1988.     Each system 6800 automated disk library can accommodate up to 150, 14-inch optical disks. Each disk provides 6.8 gigabytes of randomly accessible on-line storage. Thus, Kodak pointed out, 150 disks render the more-than-a-terabyte capacity.     Kodak said it will begin deliveries of the KIMS system 5000 in mid-1987. The open-ended and media-independent system  allows users to incorporate existing and emerging technologies, including erasable optical disks, high-density magnetic media, fiber optics and even artificial intelligence, is expected to sell in the 700,000 dlr range.     Initially this system will come in a 12-inch optical disk version which provides data storage and retrieval through a disk library with a capacity of up to 121 disks, each storing 2.6 gigabytes.     Kodak said the KIMS system 3000 is the baseline member of the family of KIMS systems. Using one or two 12-inch manually loaded optical disk drives, it will sell for about 150,000 dlrs with deliveries beginning in mid-year.     The company said the system 3000 is fulling compatibal with the more powerful KIMS system 5000.     It said the KIMS system 4500 uses the same hardware and software as the system 5000. It will be available in mid-1987 and sell in the 150,000 dlr range.  Reuter ;

De Croo said at a news conference "if you limit textile imports, you will re-orient textiles to Europe."     And that he said would trigger EC taxes on U.S. goods.     Congress passed a textile bill two years ago, but it was vetoed by President Reagan on grounds that curbing imports to protect the domestic textile industry would trigger retaliation U.S. trading partners.     A similar bill has been introducted this year, in a Congress with a bigger Democratic majority and with a President weakened by the Iran scandal.     De Croo, here for talks with Administration officials and Congressmen, said if a textile bill passed, "the only way we could react would be retaliation, and it would cause more retaliation, which is not a good way to deal with problems."

TEST; 3-MAR-1987 13:13:47.06;WALL STREET STOCKS/ANACOMP INC <AAC>;  Anacomp Inc, one of the most actively traded NYSE issues, rose today as at least one analyst expected earnings to be boosted by its planned acquisition of a micrographics company.     Anacomp rose 1/2 to 6-3/4 on volume of 950,000 shares after trading as high as seven earlier.     Howard Harlow, analyst at Whale Securities Corp, said Anacomp's earnings for fiscal 1987 ending September 31 could be doubled to 80 cts a share from the 40 cts a share he had forecast before Anacomp agreed to buy DatagraphiX, a micrographics firm, from General Dynamics Corp <GD>.     "The company can earn 80 cts a share in fiscal 1987, maybe as much as a dlr a share, because of DatagraphiX," Harlow said. "Most of the benefit will be in the fourth qtr because it will integrate the company in the second half."     Anacomp's earnings will be less if it has problems integrating DatagraphiX, Harlow said.     A spokesman at Anacomp said the company expects to complete its deal for DatagraphiX later this month. She would not say how much it will pay for DatagraphiX, but noted that DatagraphiX contributed 10 mln dlrs in earnings to General Dynamics on revenues of 239 mln dlrs in 1986.     Harlow said a fellow analyst at Whale Securities estimates that Anacomp will pay between 100 mln dlrs to 150 mln dlrs for DatagraphiX. "The estimates on the street narrow it down to between 110 mln dlrs and 130 mln dlrs," Harlow added.     Anacomp reported net of 2.8 mln dlrs or nine cts a share in its first qtr ended December 31, up from 301,000 dlrs or one ct a share.     In Anacomp's fiscal 1986 it earned 4,073,000 dlrs or 13 cts a share.     Whale Securities recommends buying the stock, Harlow said.  Reuter ;

TEST; 3-MAR-1987 14:17:36.13;ROSTENKOWSKI RELUCTANT TO BACK TAX HIKE;  House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said he would be reluctant to back the tax increase if it did not have President Reagan's support.     He told a National Press Club luncheon there would be a number of tax proposals that could be debated if Reagan sought a tax increase to help balance the budget.     However, he said he would prefer to leave the tax rates enacted in last year's tax reform bill unchanged.     There have been calls in Congress to hold the rates at the 1987 level rather than allow them to fall next year.     Reagan proposed 22 billion dlrs in revenue as part of his 1988 budget proposal, but it did not include general tax increases.     On trade issues, Rostenkowski said he did not expect the major trade bill this year would single out any U.S. industry for special protection.     "To go after individual items in a trade bill is suicide," he said.     This apparently ruled out congressional approval of another textile trade bill to limit quotas on textile imports, as was proposed again this year.  Reuter ;

The company said the HP LaserJet II offers more capabilities than earlier models, but at 2,495 dlrs, costs 500 dlrs less than previous machines. The LaserJet II prints eight pages a minute and can be used for desktop publishing, word processing, and spreadsheet and graphics printing.     It also said it introduced a larger laser printer to accommodate numerous workstations and a machine used to scan documents.     The company also said it introduced the HP LaserJet 2000, its first printer designed to be used with personal computer networks, departmental systems and minicomputers. It can print 20 pages a minute, and has an entry price of 19,995 dlrs.     It also unveiled the SP ScanJet, a flatbed desktop device  that scans printed images of text. The scanner works like a photocopier storing the copied images on a hard disk, the company said. It costs 1,495 dlrs.     Hewlett Packard also said it brought out a new family of plotter machines, the HP Draftmasters I and II. The new models replace the HP 758X series of drafting-plotter line machines used for computer aided design. The Draftmaster costs 9,900 dlrs, and the Draftsmaster II, 11,900 dlrs.

TEST; 3-MAR-1987 15:32:05.85;F.W. WOOLWORTH'S <Z> 1986 PROFITS RISE 21 PCT;     By Gail Appleson, Reuter The specialty retailing area continues to pay off for F.W. Woolworth Co, once known only as a five and dime store chain, which said its 1986 income rose 21 pct.     It was the fourth consecutive year of profit increases for the New York-based retailer which was founded over 100 years ago.     Woolworth's 1986 income rose to 214 mln dlrs or 3.25 dlrs per share compared with 1985's profit of 177 mln or 2.75 dlrs per share. Revenues for the year rose to 6.50 billion compared with the prior year's 5.96 billion.     For the fourth quarter, the company reported profits rose 10 pct to 117 mln dlrs or 1.78 dlrs per share compared with 1985 fourth quarter results of 106 mln or 1.64 dlrs per share. Revenues rose to 2.02 billion from 1.85 billion dlrs.     Roy Garofalo, Woolworth vice president, told Reuters that income generated by the company's specialty store operations accounted for 52 pct of the parent company's 1986 profits.     He said the company now has 4,700 specialty stores operating under 30 different names. Woolworth plans to open 650 more specialty stores in 1987. At this time last year, it operated 4,100 specialty stores, Garofalo said.     Garofalo said the largest specialty chain operated by Woolworth is Kinney Shoe Stores, followed by the Richman apparel unit. Among other units are Little Folk Shop, a chain of discount children's apparel stores  The Rx Place, a discount drug, health and beauty aid operation  and Face Fantasies, which sells cosmetics. There are currently about 1,700 Woolworth general merchandise stores operating worldwide, of which 1,200 are in the United States.     Harold Sells, chairman and chief executive of Woolworth, said in a statement, "These results are especially gratifying as they are an improvement over last year's record earnings."     Sells that it was the fourth successive year earnings in each quarter improved over the corresponding year-earlier period.     Woolworth's variety store operations were hard hit in the 1970's and early 1980's by the quickly growing discount store industry. In an attempt to compete in the 1970's, Woolworth opened a discount general store chain, Woolco, and J. Brannam, a discount apparel chain. Both were failures in the United States, although Woolco still operates in Canada.     In 1985, however, Woolworth changed its strategy and announced that it would operate specialty stores. At that time, the company said it would create 14 new groups of such stores. Specialty stores generally have higher sales per square foot than general merchandise stores.      Reuter ;

The measure, sponsored by committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Sen. John Melcher (D-Mont.), would establish trade teams of between six and nine persons drawn from federal agencies and private voluntary organizations, staff said.     The trade missions would seek to generate interest in the U.S. government's food donation and commercial programs -- PL480, Section 416, export credit and export enhancement -- and upon return be required to advocate extension of concessional or commercial benefits to interested countries.     The trade teams would be made up of representatives of the U.S. Agriculture Department, State Department, the Agency for International Development and private voluntary organizations such as U.S. Wheat Associates.     The bill would require teams within six months to visit seven countries: Mexico, Philippines, Indonesia, India, Bangladesh, Senegal and Nigeria.     Within one year after passage of the measure, another eight countries would have to be visited: Peru, Kenya, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Malaysia, Venezuela, Tunisia and Morocco.

TEST; 3-MAR-1987 17:11:38.35;SECURITIES TAX WOULD NEED WHITE HOUSE SUPPORT;  House Ways and Means Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski would want White House support for any tax increase, including a tax on securities transactions, before considering the issue, a staff member said.     In addition, congressional leaders have not agreed on whether they will seek any tax increase this year, he said.     Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat whose committee is in charge of tax legislation, met this afternoon with House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, to discuss a variety of tax and budget issues, an aide said. He added that Wright did not endorse the securities transfer tax but raised it yesterday as a possible way to cut the federal deficit.     The aide to Wright added that Wright asked the Ways and Means Committee to look into the securities transfer tax. However, he said Wright had not recommended it as he had another tax proposal to hold income tax rates at the 1987 level rather than allow the 1987 tax rate cut to take place.     Wright brought up a 0.5 pct tax on all sales and purchases of publicly traded securities as a way to raise about 17 billion dlrs a year, the aide said.     The New York Stock Exchange said it had not seen the proposal by the House Speaker but added that it is "strongly opposed to any proposal to impose a transfer tax on securities transactions."     NYSE vice president Richard Torrenzano said in a statement, "Such a tax would be paid by millions of investors nationwide and would be counter-productive, making America's securities industry vulnerable to foreign competition at a time when financial markets are becoming increasingly international."

TEST; 3-MAR-1987 17:20:21.62;PENNZOIL <PZL> SAYS IT HAS MADE SETTLEMENT OFFERS;  Pennzoil Co chairman J. Hugh Liedtke said the company has made several proposals to Texaco Inc <TX>  to settle a 9.13 billion dlr judgment awarded to Pennzoil and that a settlement was "in the best interests of both companies."     Liedtke, in a letter mailed today to Pennzoil shareholders, said Texaco's management has incorrectly implied in recent public statements that Pennzoil was not interested in settling the case.     "Pennzoil has made Texaco several proposals, both before and after trial, to settle this dispute," Liedtke said in the letter. "We do not know why Texaco's officials would now make such clearly untrue statements."     Last month, a Texas state appeals court upheld a jury judgment that Texaco illegally interfered with Pennzoil's plan to acquire Getty Oil in 1983. The appeals court reduced by two billion dlrs the original 10.53 billion dlrs in damages awarded to Pennzoil, but interest accruing on the award has pushed the total amount back above 10 billion dlrs.     Pennzoil said that Texaco had made four unsatisfactory proposals to settle the billion-dollar lawsuit.     "Other than to put on the record that it has made offers, Texaco's proposals make no sense," Liedtke said in the letter. "In fact, two of Texaco's offers were identical and were proposals that Texaco knew in advance Pennzoil would not accept."     The letter did not disclose terms of settlement offers made by either Pennzoil or Texaco.     "If and when Texaco's management changes its position and demonstrates a willingness to make a good faith attempt to settle this matter, Pennzoil will make every effort to cooperate," Liedtke said. "Such a solution, I believe, is clearly in the interests of both companies, even if it not attractive, as a personal matter, to Texaco's management and directors."     Liedtke said that cash flow from the Getty Oil assets and profits from those assets that have since been sold "approximately equaled" Texaco's purchase price of 10 billion dlrs for Getty.

TEST; 3-MAR-1987 18:17:38.58;CBT TRADERS LOOK AHEAD TO SPRING PLANTINGS;  Chicago Board of trade grain traders and analysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned to handle their upcoming spring plantings, prompting sales of new crop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeans in the futures markets.     Professionals in the grains trade think that farmers will be more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans because corn is protected by the acreage reduction program. That gives deficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low.     Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if they sign-up for reduced acreage, but they have no price guarantees.     With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal, traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thing rather than gamble on soybeans, even though the new crop soybean/corn ratio of 2.9/1 would make planting soybeans more attractive under normal circumstances.     An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift the limited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop, means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mln more oat acres this year than last without being penalized, traders said.     Here too, acres some farmers may have been thinking of shifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats, due to the more attractive deal from the government, they added.     Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just six months ago, which should prompt many farmers in the South to put soybean land back into cotton.     One of the reasons for the steady increase in soybean production in recent years has been a general shift of acres in traditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans, which are easier to grow, one commercial trader said.

He told reporters this year's borrowing forecast exceeded immediate needs, but Greece wanted to take advantage of low international interest rates in order to make servicing payments at a lower cost.     Greece's foreign debts totalled 16.8 billion dlrs at end-1986, up from 15.2 billion at end-1985, Halikias said.     He said the extra funds available to Greece this year will go towards servicing debts falling due after 1990. He did not give figures.     He said Greece was able to cut borrowing because a two-year austerity program it adopted in October, 1985 cut its current account deficit to 1.75 billion dlrs last year from a record 3.3 billion in 1985.     Halikias said he was "fairly optimistic" Greece would reach a current account deficit target of 1.25 billion dlrs this year.     He said domestic demand has fallen, reducing the need for imports, while Greek exports are becoming more competitive.     Economy Ministry figures show exports rose to 4.9 billion dlrs in the first 11 months of 1986 from 4.1 billion in the same. 1985 period, while imports dipped to 10.2 billio dlrs from 11.4 billion.

TEST; 4-MAR-1987 10:19:55.55;VENEZUELA SETS FOREIGN DEBT TARGETS;  Venezuela plans to have a public sector foreign debt of 26.5 billion dlrs by early 1989 when the present government of President Jaime Lusinchi ends its term, public finances director Jorge Marcano said.     He said the target, which compares with around 24.5 billion dlrs now and 29 billion at end 1983, is considered a manageable amount which will assist in development plans.     The government last week reached agreement with its 13-bank advisory committee to reprogramme its 12-1/2 year rescheduling accord over 14 years with the interest margin lowered to 7/8 pct over London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) from 1-1/8 pct.     In an interview with El Universal newspaper, Marcano said he thought U.S. Government pressure on banks had more to do with the unexpectedly speedy agreement than Brazil's decision to suspend interest payments.     "I think what speeded an agreement was the attitude of the U.S. Government, which urged several major banks to soften their position in various debt renegotiations. The Brazil announcement came later," he said.     Bankers noted Citibank had held up an agreement with Chile, objecting to proposals for delayed interest payments. A pact with Chile, with a one pct spread, came a day before Venezuela's.     Marcano said a telex sent to Venezuela's 450 creditors seeks support for the government's foreign borrowing plans, which are aimed at aluminium, steel and iron ore projects. "We cannot rule out a trip to financial centres to explain the new agreement and present the financing programmes we have," he said, adding he hoped to restore credit ratings of the 1970s.     Lusinchi said on Monday the government will limit foreign borrowing, which would come from banks and multilateral agencies, to 50 pct of interest and principal paid in the next two years. According to the restructured accord, this would work out at around 2.5 billion dlrs.  REUTER ;

Funaro told reporters his trip, which has already taken him to London, Paris and Bonn, was aimed at explaining his country's stance to governments. Talks with commercial banks will take place at a later date.     Funaro said a mechanism would have to be found to end Brazil's debt crisis but it would not be easy.     Brazil would not repeat the measures it took in response to its debt crisis of 1982, which he said had provoked the biggest recession in his country's history, he added.     He said European and Japanese banks were showing a more flexible attitude towards Brazil's problems than U.S. Banks and it was difficult to discuss capitalisation with the latter.     A Swiss official said the Brazilian delegation had made no demands.     Funaro, who travels to Italy this evening, said it was unclear if he would go to Japan on Friday or return to Brazil first.

TEST; 4-MAR-1987 13:51:01.55;CANADA WHEAT BOARD ADVISES CUT IN GRAIN PRICES;  The Canadian Wheat Board has advised the federal government to sharply cut initial prices paid to farmers for their wheat, oats, and barley in the crop year beginning August 1, a board spokesman said.     The spokesman declined to give the size of the recommended price drops but said it would not be good news for western Canadian grain growers.     "They're all lower," he said. "This is really getting pretty serious. We're talking nuts and bolts economic survival and whether it's worthwhile for farmers to put in a crop."     Farm leaders and economists have estimated the board will recommend cuts of around 20 pct in the initial prices.     Farmers receive the initial payment when the grain is delivered to the elevators used by the wheat board.     If the wheat board, which markets most of Canada's grain, obtains higher than expected prices on world markets, the farmers receive a final payment at the end of the crop year. If prices are lower, the federal treasury makes up the difference.     The final decision on the initial prices, usually made in April, rests with Wheat Board Minister Charles Mayer and the federal cabinet.     Last year Mayer cut the initial prices between 19 and 27 pct but last fall the government announced a one billion Canadian dlr aid program to compensate for the price cuts.     But federal agricultural officials have already warned farmers not to depend on additional government aid this year.  Reuter ;

TEST; 5-MAR-1987 05:02:29.84;JAPANESE BANKS SEEN AGREEING DEBT RISK SCHEME;     By Tsukasa Maekawa, Reuters Japanese creditor banks are close to a decision to jointly establish an offshore firm to which they will transfer part of their title to possibly unrecoverable debts owed by developing nations, international financial sources told Reuters.     Details of the deal are likely be decided next week and the firm set up before the end of the month, they said.     The scheme is intended to improve financial management at the banks and reduce the risk of problems in the event of debts turning bad, the sources said.     Last week's announcement by Brazil that it would indefinitely suspend interest payments on an estimated 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks prompted Japanese creditors to finalise the project, the sources said.     Major Japanese banks have been considering a plan to avoid a debt crisis since the start of the year, they said.     There are likely to be at least 10 participating banks, and perhaps as many as 28, they said.     About 30 Japanese commercial banks have outstanding loans totalling over 10 billion dlrs to Brazil, accounting for about 15 pct of all commercial loans to that country.     The most likely venue for the envisaged firm is the Caribbean tax haven of the Cayman Islands, the sources said.     The idea is to create a pool of funds in the firm with participating creditor banks holding the firm's stock.     The firm will then use the funds to buy from its stock-holding banks title to repayments of specified foreign loans which are potentially bad, the sources said.     The stock-holding banks will draw up a list of such loans.     Subject to the scheme would be loans extended to debt-ridden countries such as Mexico and Argentina, they said.     The financial sources said interest payments to the firm would not be taxed because of its location. Japanese banks have asked the finance ministry to increase tax breaks on loan loss reserves, but the ministry has not yet complied.     A senior ministry official welcomed the scheme and said it may encourage new lending to developing countries.     The ministry instructs banks to establish reserves for up to five pct of their loans to 35 financially troubled countries, but it only grants tax breaks on reserves accounting for one pct of the loans.

The company said the unsolicited bid by the Carl C. Icahn-led TWA was "highly conditional."     USAir said its board and that of Piedmont Aviation Inc <PIE> met separately yesterday to consider USAir's offer to acquire 50.1 pct of Piedmont for 71 dlrs per share and remaining shares for 1.5 to 1.9 common shares each, valued at about 73 dlrs per share based on the average closing price of USAir common during a period just before the merger.     The company said it is continuing talks with Piedmont on arriving at a definitive merger agreement and the two companies hope to reach one very shortly.     USAir said "In light of the highly conditional nature and other terms of the TWA offer, the timing of the offer and the circumstances under which it was made, USAir Group believes that the purpose of the TWA offer is to interfere with USAir Group's proposed acquisition of Piedmont.     "TWA's proposal is nothing more than an attempt by Carl Icahn to disrupt at the eleventh hour USAir Group's acquisition of Piedmont, a transaction which the USAir Group board views as most beneficial to USAir Group shareholders, employees and passengers and which Mr. Icahn obviously regards as contrary to his own personal interests."     USAir said its board has authorized counsel to explore all appropriate legal remedies against what it called TWA's last-minute attempt to interfere with USAir Group's acquisition of Piedmont.     The company said conditions to the TWA offer include TWA obtaining financing, the USAir board redeeming defensive rights issued to shareholders last year and acting to render the "fair price" provision contained in USAir's charter inapplicable to the TWA offer and Transportation Department approval.

TEST; 5-MAR-1987 09:27:39.53;SPEAKER SEEKING SUPPORT FOR U.S. TAX INCREASES;  House Speaker Jim Wright is lobbying congressmen to support a plan to cut the 1988 budget deficit about 40 billion dlrs, half through spending cuts and the remainder through tax hikes, congressional sources said.     He is backing a half and half plan and has made the suggestion to Democrats on the House Budget Committee privately, committee sources said.     However, a committee source told Reuters that committee Democrats already generally favor a plan to cut the deficit about 40 billion dlrs, half through taxes and the Speaker's move was seen as building support outside the committee.     Wright's 20 billion dlr revenue raising plan has no specifics, although he has floated a stock transfer tax and also has suggested deferring tax cuts due to the wealthy.     Neither of those plans has caught fire yet in Congress, and some congressmen are cool to the idea of a stock tax.     The Budget committee is considering a 1988 budget aimed at reducing the estimated deficit of 170 billion dlrs as estimated by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.     Committee Chairman William Gray has publicly backed a budget cutting move of 40 billion dlrs but says that will not reach the Gramm-Rudman deficit target for 1988 of 108 billion dlrs, although he claims it will be in the spirit of it.

TEST; 5-MAR-1987 09:56:03.54;ENZON <ENZN> SAYS DRUG TREATS DISEASE;  Enzon Inc said a new treatment using its investigational new drug PEG-ADA has restored the functioning of the immune system in the first two children that were born deficient in the enzyme adenosine deaminase.     The disorder is known as severe combined immunodeficiency disease, or "bubble boy disease"     Bubble Boy Disease is a rare but severe disease that hampers the development of the immune system. It has killed most of its victims before adulthood.     Children with the disease are consigned to live in a sterile environment, such as a plastic bubble, to avoid infection, the company said.     The study of Enzon's drug, conducted at Duke University, showed that two children suffering from the disease were treated for 11 and seven months, respectively, and were free of serious infection during that time, the company said. The results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.     The disease is caused by a missing enzyme, called Adenosine Deaminase, or ADA, that is crucial to the development of the immune system.     Enzon said it has developed a technology to coat the enzyme with a substance called polyethylene glycol, or PEG, serving to disguise the enzyme when it is reintroduced into the body, preventing rejection.     "Marked improvement in laboratory tests of immune function occurred in each child, along with an increase in the number of T-lymphocytes, the immune cells that were missing before treatment with PEG-ADA had begun," the study said.     "The children are now more active and have begun to gain weight and height. Before treatment their growth had been very poor in comparison to normal children of the same age," the study, conducted by Doctors Michael Hershfield and Rebecca Buckley, said.     The PEG-ADA injections were given once a week. Victims of the disease have traditionally been treated by bone marrow transplants, but for most, donors are not available or transplantation is unsuccessful, the company said. Other diseases caused by a missing enzyme might also be treated by introducing a PEG coated enzyme, the article noted.  Reuter ;

TEST; 5-MAR-1987 10:56:40.36;BRAZIL HAS NO SET COFFEE EXPORT TARGETS - IBC;  Brazil has no set target for its coffee exports following this week's breakdown of International Coffee Organization talks on export quotas, President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, Jorio Dauster said.     He told a press conference Brazil now had to reconsider its export plans and that the 15.5 mln bag export figure which it had proposed for itself earlier should no longer be taken as the country's export target to ICO-member countries.     The 15.5 mln bag offer had been made on the assumption an agreement would bring stability to world markets, he added.     It had been a gesture to ease negotiations, but the lack of an agreement leaves it no longer valid and exports could be above or below 15.5 mln bags, he said.     Dauster said he would talk to producers, exporters and market analysts before taking any decision on export policy, but any future policy would be flexible and adjusted to market conditions.     "We will not take any short-term decisions which might cause markets to panic," Dauster added.     He said it would be a policy which shows Brazil has coffee to sell and that it could do so without an ICO agreement.     "Brazil has coffee (to sell) and wants to show that it does not need an ICO agreement as a crutch," Dauster said.     Commenting on the breakdown of the talks, Dauster said consumer proposals would have implied a reduction of one to two mln bags in Brazil's export quotas.     "It was a proposal which would lead to a substantial loss for Brazil and which would be difficult for the country to recover," he said.     The consumer proposal to base quotas on a six-year moving average of exportable production surpluses would lead to overproduction as countries boosted output to win higher quotas, he said.     Dauster rejected reports which said Brazil's inflexibility had been the cause for the breakdown of talks, noting that its stance had the backing of 85 pct of producing countries.     Close links would continue with these producers, particularly Colombia, Mexico and Francophone African countries, but Dauster said no joint marketing action was envisaged at present.     He also said Brazil currently had no plans to return to a system of roaster buying contracts, although "no hypothesis has been abandoned."     Dauster said he had not yet decided when registrations for May shipment coffee will be opened.     He declined comment on whether the IBC will adopt a policy of opening registrations for up to six months in advance, as some exporters had suggested.     He noted export registrations for the first four months of the year totalled around 5.5 mln bags, more than half the 9.9 mln exported in 1986 when drought reduced the crop to between 11.2 mln and 12 mln bags.     He said that, although he had heard forecasts of 30 mln bags for the coming crop, the IBC would not make any estimate until late April.  Reuter ;

"We favor shortening the disclosure period to two days," Shad told members of the House Telecommunications and Finance subcommittee when asked for his recommendation.     He said the SEC's responsibility was to provide full disclosure for securities, including junk bonds, and not to make decisions based on merit.

He declined to comment on the situation of specific nations and said it was not the Fed's role to become involved in such talks.

However, he added, the recent bull market on Wall Street had also made corporate equity levels soar, keeping corporate debt to equity ratios about constant.

TEST; 5-MAR-1987 14:18:23.25;YEUTTER SAYS BUDGET CUT KEY TO BETTER U.S. TRADE;  A reduction of the U.S. federal budget deficit will be needed to help eliminate the nation's huge trade deficit, U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter said.     Speaking to the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Yeutter said "Capital and trade flows are clearly inter-releated now.     "Unless we get the budget deficit down, we will not get the trade deficit down."     He did not elaborate on his views of the linkages between the two deficits.     Private analysts have said that the financing of large U.S. budget deficits requires heavy capital inflows from overseas investors through purchases of U.S. Treasury and, to a lesser extent, other U.S. securities as well.     "We'll make some progress in reducing the 170 billion dlr trade deficit in 1987, but there's still a long way to go," Yeutter said.     He said the problem must be approached on many fronts and focus most strongly on U.S. and overseas fiscal and monetary policies to foster economic growth, U.S. competitiveness and the establishment of a "level playing field" for trade.     The U.S. trade representative said the Federal Reserve under Chairman Paul Volcker has done its part to improve the trade situation by getting interest rates down.     On the fiscal side, Yeutter said "the budget deficit is still our biggest problem" and there has not been enough progress toward reducing that deficit.     In the international area, he said that "our major trading partners could still do more to stimulate domestic growth." Commenting on Japan, which is running around a 80 billion dlr trade surplus with the United States, Yeutter said "Japan is just not doing the job on the import side."     Yeutter declined to comment on statements relating to the dollar made earlier today by Commerce Dept undersecretary of Economic Affairs Robert Ortner.     In a Washington address to an Export-Import Bank sponsored meeting, Ortner said he believed the dollar at current levels was fairly priced against most European currencies, but that the yen is 10 or 15 pct undervalued.     "The market will determine the dollar's proper value in the end," Yeutter said. However, he added that, if the U.S. and other nations do not take the necessary steps to cut the U.S. trade deficit, "the dollar will be the equalizer."     Yeutter said there is no quick fix to the trade problem and any resort to such tactics as protectionist trade legislation or trade restrictions poses real dangers.     He said "there's relatively little that Congress can do to legislate a solution to the trade problem."     Protectionist legislation will only provoke retaliation by U.S. trading partners, Yeutter said.     "There is no doubt in my mind about the willingness of our trading partners to retaliate against unfair trade legislation," Yeutter said, adding that policy flexibility is essential in solving international trade problems.

TEST; 5-MAR-1987 14:47:47.62;HOUSE 0/92 FARM PROPOSAL SEEN SPARKING DEBATE;  A House Agriculture Committee meeting later today to draft a disaster aid bill is expected to spark a debate between lawmakers who want to expand the 0/92, or "de-coupling," provision to cover feedgrains, and those who oppose 0/92 or want it severely limited, Congressional sources said.     The disaster aid bill as it now stands calls for a one-year 0/92 pilot program for 1987 crop wheat and the 1988 winter wheat crop. The bill would allow farmers to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of deficiency payments.     The administration has strongly urged that the bill be expanded to feedgrains and to more than one year.     It is difficult to tell in what form the 0/92 provision will emerge from the committee, the sources said.     Proponents of an expansion of 0/92 maintain there are large estimated cost savings of such a bill -- ranging from estimates by the administration of 200 to 500 mln dlrs.     Opposition to a reopening of the 1985 farm bill at this time is the major reason cited by those against an expansion of the bill, committee staffers said.     The 0/92 plan is scheduled to be discussed at 1530 EST. A conflicting floor vote delayed the start of the meeting, and staffers said it may have to be delayed even until next week.     Such a delay would not bode well for proponents of an expanded 0/92 program, since spring planting in many areas of the country will be underway in the next few weeks and signup for the 1987 wheat and feedgrains program ends March 30.     Farmers are now making their planting decisions, so something has to be done quickly if a 0/92 program is to be implemented, an Agriculture Department source said.     An expansion of 0/92 to feedgrains was opposed in last week's subcommittee hearing on the bill, with subcommittee chairman Dan Glickman, D-Kan., saying that more study of the consequences of decoupling on feedgrains plantings was necessary.     Major commodity groups, including the National Corn Growers, the American Farm Bureau and the National Cattlemen's Association, have voiced strong opposition to 0/92.     But proponents of an expanded 0/92 argue that the bill currently is not equitable for all grains producers, so it should be extended to other crops.     There will be difficulty in limiting 0/92 to wheat, said Gene Moos, aide to house majority leader Tom Foley, D-Wash.     Projected cost savings, in the current atmosphere of try to decrease farm expenditures, would also be hard to ignore in the debate to expand the 0/92 application, Moos said.     Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Tex., may be planning to introduce a bill to restrict 0/92 to only 1987 crop wheat, with the argument that now is not the time to vote in favor of any major changes in the farm bill.     "Stenholm's bill is not a rejection of 0/92, only of the timing," a congressional staff member said.     Rep. Arland Stangeland (R-Minn.) is reported to have an amendment to expand the 0/92 provision to 1987 and 1988 feedgrains.  Reuter ;

TEST; 5-MAR-1987 15:13:28.99;OPEC PRESIDENT SAYS OUTPUT WELL BELOW CEILING;     By Judith Matloff, Reuters Opec Conference President Rilwanu Lukman said the group was producing well below the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling it set in December, partly because liftings had been delayed or postponed by customers unwilling to pay fixed Opec prices.     Lukman, during a brief visit to London on his way home from Jamaica, told Reuters in a telephone interview that in February, Opec had underproduced partly because members were strictly abiding by production quotas and partly because they were resisting the temptation to sell at discounts to official prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.     "We are determined to stand firm by the (December) accord," he said. "I have spoken to every other Opec minister and they are committed to making the accord work," he said.     Lukman gave no specific figures for February output. He said the Opec secretariat in Vienna was finalizing these figures.     Told of a Reuters survey published today which estimated that Opec output so far this week was below 15 mln bpd, he said  "That could well be correct."     Opec"s news agency Opecna today issued a statement saying group output was "well below" its ceiling in February. But it gave no figures.     But one source close to Opec indicated that February output may have been between 15.3 and 15.5 mln bpd.     The Reuter survey estimated Opec February output at around 16 mln bpd.     Opec agreed in December to cut output by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and to return to fixed prices starting February 1.     Lukman said Qatar, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Iran had all produced in February below their Opec quotas. Iraq, which said it would not honour its 1.466 mln bpd quota under the December pact, had produced less than had been anticipated, he said.     Lukman said that some industry reports "may be correct" that in February, Nigeria propuced 75-100,000 bpd below its 1.238 mln bpd quota, Saudi Arabia 500,000 bpd less than its 4.133 mln allocation and Qatar 20 to 30 pct under its 285,000 bpd quota.     He said that sweet crudes such as those produced by his country were coming under price pressure because they were currently officially priced above sweet North Sea grades and the United States" West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude.     However, he said Opec in December had anticipated that demand would be slack at this time of year for seasonal reasons and expected the market to firm in two to three weeks.     "We have to be patient for two or three weeks. The market is now firming on actual fundamentals," he said, adding that he expected it to go "up and up" even beyond official prices after early April. This is when, traditionally, there is more demand for gasoline-rich crudes such as Nigeria"s.     The Opec President said producers such as Kuwait, Venezuela and Indonesia were having less problems with output than producers like his own country because they exported oil products.     Also, some of Venezuela"s heavy grades were outside the Opec pricing system, he said.     Lukman said that if refiner-buyers, now refusing to lift some Opec oil at official prices, instead used their own stocks and ran them down to "dangerous levels," they would eventually have to buy Opec oil.     "When they realise it is not a free-for-all (in the market) they will realise they should buy now instead of paying more later on," he said.     Lukman, asked about industry reports that Nigeria was being pressured by equity producers for better terms, said it was important to know that terms with them were negotiable, flexible and under constant review, not only when the market seemed weak.     He said that so far, no meeting of the seven-nation ministerial differentials committee had been scheduled and that such a meeting, now twice-postponed, was not a high priority for Opec at the moment.     "At this time, we have to get our priorities right," he said. "The most important thing now is ensuring that the accord is working, not dealing with a differential of cents between grades."     But if any Opec member raised concerns or objections over the differential system, a meeting would be called, he said.  Reuter ;

The ITC ruled provisionally last June 18 that the domestic industry was being injured by Brazilian orange juice imports.

TEST; 5-MAR-1987 15:43:50.58;CANADA DLR DRIVEN BY FOREIGN BUYERS - WILSON;  Finance Minister Michael Wilson said large inflows of capital into Canada, principally into the country's bond market, is a major reason behind the sharp recovery in the Canadian dollar.     He said the inflow of funds, mainly from Japan, Europe and the United States, is the result of "confidence in the direction this country is going in."     "That is the reason why the (Canadian) dollar today is higher than 75 cts (U.S.) compared to this time last year (when it was) a little over 69 cts," Wilson told the House of Commons daily question period.     Figures released this week show foreigners purchased a record 23.1 billion dlrs of Canadian bonds in 1986, more than double the previous year, with Japan investing a record 9.5 billion dlrs in the market.     Wilson was responding to opposition party questions about a possible loss of jobs from the rise in Canadian investment abroad. Canadian investment, including the buying of foreign companies, stocks and bonds, rose to 12.53 billion dlrs from 6.19 billion dlrs in 1985.     The minister said the flow of funds from abroad would generate many new jobs in Canada.  Reuter ;

TEST; 5-MAR-1987 18:03:43.27;IEA SAYS OPEC FEBRUARY CRUDE OUTPUT 16.1 MLN BPD;  OPEC produced an average 16.1 mln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil in February, down from 16.5 mln the previous month and an overall 17.3 mln bpd in fourth quarter 1986, the International Energy Agency said.     A few OPEC countries last month exceeded the production quotas set at their last conference in December, but liftings were reduced from several countries, it said in its latest monthly oil market report.     These cutbacks were due in part to buyer resistance to fixed prices, introduced from February 1, particularly for fixed volumes over an extended period.

Contracts for Saudi crude have been signed, but it is understood they have much leeway in required liftings.     The report said the reduction in Iraqi air attacks on Iranian export facilities allowed Iran's output to reach 2.2 mln bpd in January, but buyer resistance to fixed prices apparently cut February production.     It said Iraqi exports are about 1.0 mln bpd through the Turkish pipeline, 0.1-0.2 mln by truck through Jordan and 0.2-0.3 mln via the Saudi pipeline to Yanbu. Internal consumption is some 0.3 mln bpd.     The IEA estimated total non-communist world oil supply in February at 45.0 mln bpd, down from 45.4 mln in January and 47.0 mln in the fourth quarter.     The February world supply figure is made up of 16.1 mln bpd OPEC crude production, 1.4 mln bpd OPEC natural gas liquids (ngls), 16.6 mln bpd OECD crude and ngls, 8.3 mln bpd other developing countries' crude and ngls, net trade of 1.1 mln bpd with centrally planned economies, 0.5 mln bpd of non-conventional crudes (such as tar sands and oil from coal) and 1.0 mln bpd from processiing gains.     Within the OECD, preliminary Norwegian data show record 1.06 mln bpd output in January, with lower production expected in February in accordance with government curtailments of approximately 80,000 bpd, announced in support of OPEC.

Viner Holdings Ltd said the earlier reported Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing of Heck's Inc <HEX>, in which Viner holds 408,000 shares, would not materially affect Viner's capital position or its ability to carry on its profitable brokerage business.     Viner said its brokerage subsidiary, Edward A. Viner and Co had regulatory capital of 24.5 mln U.S. dlrs at year-end 1986.

TEST; 5-MAR-1987 18:51:02.27;TWA <TWA> SUES USAIR <U> OVER POISON PILL;  Trans World Airlines Inc said it filed suit in Delaware Chancery Court against USAir Group Inc and its board of directors seeking to invalidate its "poison pill" anti-takeover plan.     TWA vice president and general counsel Mark Buckstein said TWA also sought a declaratory judgement from the court that its 52 dlr per share takeover offer for USAir would in no way interfer with USAir's possible buyout of Peidmont Aviation Inc <PIE>.     Buckstein said TWA asked the court to enjoin the enforcement of USAir's shareholder rights plan, or "poison pill." Such provisions, which typically allow for the issue of securities to shareholders in the event of a hostile takeover bid, are aimed at deterring takeovers by making them more expensive.     USAir earlier today rejected TWA's offer, saying TWA's bid was an attempt to interfer with its buyout of Piedmont.     USAir also had said its counsel would investigate the matter. Tonight, a spokesman for USAir said the airline had no comment on TWA's lawsuit.     USAir did respond, however, to a TWA request to the Department of Transportation for permission to buy up to 51 pct of USAir stock and place the stock in a voting trust pending approval of a takeover.     USAir said the request was "hastily pasted together in order to take advantage of a regulatory anamoly that would allow TWA to accomplish in a regulated environment actions that would be impermissable in the non-regulated economy at large."     USAir called on the transportation department to reject TWA's request.  Reuter ;

TEST; 6-MAR-1987 13:27:49.33;S/P SAYS CORPORATE DOWNGRADES MAY EASE THIS YEAR;  Standard and Poor's Corp said it expects downgrades of corporate debt ratings to ease this year from the lofty levels of 1986 and 1985.     However, the rating agency said upgrades will probably stay at about the same level as in the past few years.     The narrowing of the gap between downgrades and upgrades would reflect a calming in takeover frenzy, less volatile energy markets and slow but steady economic growth, S and P said.     In particular, S and P expects that the industrial and banking sectors would have a less turbulent year than in 1986.     S and P noted that 60 pct of 1986's downgrades were concentrated in the industrial sector, where the most negative factor was takeover fever that led to debt-financed mergers and acquisitions and costly defenses to fend off takeovers.     It said takeovers appear to be on the decline this year.     While S and P noted that the energy markets have stabilized after last year's collapse, it stressed that 1987 would not mark a turnaround for this industry.     In addition, S and P does not expect any big shocks to hit the junk bond market this year, especially of the magnitude of 1986's unexpected LTV Corp <LTV> bankruptcy filing.     Utilities, which were a positive influence in the overall 1986 trend, should be a pocket of strength again this year. But like last year, gas utilities could buck this trend, S and P said.     The rating agency said that downgrades would continue to outpace upgrades among financial institutions. But 1987's rating changes will not be as skewed as 1986's 2.1 to one ratio of downgrades to upgrades, S and P predicted.     S and P said debt ratings for the transportation industry would remain stable, aside from changes because of mergers. A detailed report will appear in the March 9 S/P Creditweek.  Reuter ;
TEST; 6-MAR-1987 13:33:10.21;CONTRA LEADER LINKS MYSTERY DLRS TO ARMS SALE;  Nicaraguan rebel leader Adolfo Calero has for the first time linked payments received for his forces to a dummy company controlled by former White House aide Oliver North, legal sources said.     The company, Lake Resources Inc, was established by North and his ally, retired Air Force major General Richard Secord, and had a Swiss bank account into which proceeds from secret arms sales to Iran were deposited.     Calero yesterday made public bank statements showing his group has received 32 mln dlrs since mid-1984, but said he has no idea who donated the money.     Calero, head of the Nicaraguan Democratic Force, known by its Spanish initials as FDN, provided the same records to a grand jury investigating the Iran arms scandal that has shaken the Reagan administration.     The bank statements he showed reporters ended with March, 1985, so they shed no light on whether Iran arms profits were diverted to contra rebels since shipments of U.S. arms to Iran did not begin until September 1985.     But last night, Calero told Cable News Network that he had just discovered deposits made in late October, 1985 by Lake Resources into a contra account in the Cayman Islands.         This came at a time when proceeds from the Iran arms sales were being funneled to the Swiss bank account.     "I just found out," he said.     Legal sources confirmed that Calero had turned over the newly disclosed information, which was brought to his attention after one of his lawyers noticed the two desposits made by Lake Resources buried in the mass of bank records.     They said that Calero has promised to review in more detail the bank statements and pass along any further information on possible deposits by the North-Secord groups.     The Tower commission said in its report that up to 19.8 mln dlrs from the sale of U.S. weapons to Iran was unaccounted for and may have been diverted to the contras.     Calero's FDN is the largest of the contra rebel groups that are fighting to overthrow the left-wing Sandinista government of Nicaragua.     On the advice of his lawyer, Calero declined to go into details about what he told the grand jury.      Reuter ;

"The negotiations are not going to prosper if (the creditor banks) do not change the counter-proposal put to Argentina, as it is a Swiss cheese full of holes," ruling Radical Party Deputy Raul Baglini said.     Baglini, who was recently observing negotiations with the steering committee for Argentina's creditor banks in New York, spoke to reporters in Mendoza, 600 miles west of Buenos Aires.     Baglini said the counter-proposal did not take into account Argentina's request for a 2.15 billion dlr loan to meet four pct growth targets in 1987.

TEST; 6-MAR-1987 15:24:32.35;ARGENTINE OBSERVER CRITICAL OF DEBT STANCE;  A counter-proposal from creditor banks to Argentina's request for rescheduling its 50 billion dlr foreign debt was full of holes, an Argentine observer at negotiations said.

TEST; 6-MAR-1987 15:38:08.64;DOME PETE<DMP> SAID TO BE PRESSED TO SELL ENCOR;     By Larry Welsh, Reuters Dome Petroleum Ltd is under pressure from one of its largest creditors, <Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce>, to sell its 42 pct stake in <Encor Energy Corp Ltd>, energy industry analysts said.     Dome has pledged its 42.5 mln Encor shares as security for part of its debt to Commerce Bank, estimated last year at 947 mln Canadian dlrs, and the bank wants Dome to sell the stock to pay down debt, analysts said.     "The Commerce has been slowly but surely moving Encor in the direction that might make it a saleable asset," said one analyst who asked not to be named.     Dome earlier said it was not considering selling Encor Energy, but reaffirmed the company's 23.3 pct interest in Canadian gold producer Dome Mines Ltd <DM> is up for sale "at the right price."     Dome, now negotiating a plan to restructure more than 6.10 billion dlrs in debt, sees Encor as a strategic investment that it does not intend to sell, spokesman David Annesley said. The Encor shares do not pay dividends.     A Commerce Bank spokesman also declined comment when asked whether it is pressing Dome to sell its Encor stake.     At current market prices, Dome's stake in Encor would be valued at about 308 mln dlrs, while its 20.9 mln Dome Mines shares would be worth about 319 mln dlrs.     Recent strength in the price of Encor shares may also prompt Commerce Bank to press Dome to divest its holding in the Canadian oil and gas producer, analysts said.     "Encor's stock price has improved quite substantially in recent weeks with a runup in crude prices," Peters and Co Ltd oil analyst Wilf Gobert commented.     "The possibility is that Commerce Bank would like to see it sold at these levels because they can get more for it now than they have been able to in recent years," he added.     Encor traded earlier on the Toronto Stock Exchange at 7-1/8, near its 52-week high of 7-1/2 and up from around six dlrs in early February.     The company also recently set up its own operating management, which was previously carried out by Dome Petroleum, Maison Placements Canada Inc analyst Denis Mote commented.     Dome and Encor "are actually going to get farther apart. So (the sale) does make a lot of sense," Mote said.     However, analysts said Dome will resist any moves to divest Encor in favor of retaining the operating assets since sale proceeds would likely go directly to pay down Dome's debt to Commerce Bank.     "I think they'll probably try to hang onto Encor as long as they can," said Bache Securities Inc analyst Doug Weber.     Some of Dome's group of 56 major creditors might move to block such a sale, arguing they have a claim on company assets.     "Other creditors generally all want to make sure that something they might be able to get a piece of is not being sold out from under them," said analyst Gobert.     Another stumbling block would be Encor's 225 mln dlr joint liability in loans to Dome Petroleum advanced by Arctic Petroleum Corp of Japan for Beaufort Sea exploration.     Analysts said a similar hurdle could also hinder the possible sale of Dome Petroleum's interest in Dome Mines.     Dome Mines has guaranteed 225 mln dlrs of Dome Petroleum's debt and has a "right of consent" to the sale of Dome Petroleum's holding.     Presumably, a potential buyer of the Dome Mines shares would seek some type of relief on the company's debt obligations connected with Dome Petroleum, Gobert said.     Dome spokesman Annesley earlier declined to specify at what price the company would consider selling its Dome Mines shares, but said current prices of more than 15 dlrs a share "are very attractive."

TEST; 6-MAR-1987 17:58:51.63;POSITIVE OUTLOOK TEMPERED IN U.S. DEBT FUTURES;     By Brad Schade, Reuters Higher oil prices and stronger than expected U.S. employment growth led to sharp losses in U.S. interest rate futures and diminished what had been a positive chart outlook, financial analysts said.     The increase of 319,000 in non-farm payroll employment during February was above market expectations for a rise of 170,000 to 200,000 jobs and sparked selling in Treasury bond futures that drove the June contract through key technical support at 101-2/32 at the opening Friday, they noted.     "I don't like that fact that we had a close below 101," said Prudential Bache analyst Fred Leiner. The 101-2/32 level in the June bond contract had been the top of a three-month trading range, which when penetrated during the rally Wednesday led to bullish forecasts by chartists.     But analysts called it a false breakout on the weekly charts when the June bond closed at 100-10/32 Friday.     Some also forecast that the high of the week at 101-19/32 may signal a bearish double top formation portending steep losses.     "I tend to go along with the double top scenario," said Northern Futures analyst Eileen Rico.     Rico noted that the possible formation, along with the fact that the rally of the last two weeks in bond futures has occurred on relatively low volume, were negative signals.     Despite what could be a negative chart outlook, Leiner remains cautiously optimistic, and June bonds should find support between 100 and 99-16/32 next week.     The optimistic outlook, as well as Leiner's expectation that the yield curve will flatten in the near term, is based on an improving inflation outlook.     With the dollar stable and economic data giving the Federal Reserve little room to ease monetary policy, "the inflation outlook is improving," Leiner said, and that should lead to relatively stronger bond prices than bill and Eurodollar prices.     Still, Leiner noted that the recent rise in oil prices remains a concern for the inflation outlook.     Oil rose during the week on reports that OPEC nations were maintaining production quotas and official prices, and got an extra boost Friday due to the suspension of oil exports from Ecuador after an earthquake Thursday.     "The runup in crude oil will be a short-lived phenomenon," said Carroll McEntee and McGinley analyst Brian Singer.     The rise in oil prices over the past week has been largely "media induced," Singer said. He noted that even though OPEC production may be within quotas, "oil stocks are at tremendously high levels."     Although the Ecuador situation could cause a delay, oil prices will eventually decline to the lows of late February, he said, and that will be a supportive influence for bond prices.  Reuter ;

Output increased by 5.6 pct from January 1985 to January 1986 and 0.9 pct from February 1985 to 1986.     The agency said the most recent increase was largely due to last year's poor performance. "No significant improvement was made in economic results," it said, adding that some successes were reported in readjusting the industrial product mix in the last quarter of 1986.     The agency said the amount of tied up working capital rose and sizeable funds were occupied by unsaleable goods in 1986.     It quoted unnamed economists as saying they expect 1987 industrial production to increase at a proper rate and with better results, due to a cost-efficiency drive underway throughout the country.

NIOC has sold its crude for March shipment to Japanese customers with different formulas. One company has bought 800,000 barrels of Iranian Heavy at a straight discount of 30-35 cents below the official price, the sources said.     Other deals have been fixed with prices linked to Oman and Dubai spot prices less a discount, they said.      Iran's discounted sales have not, however, managed to reverse the bullish tone in the crude oil and products spot markets, oil traders said.     Market sentiment is being influenced more by the colder weather in Europe, and reports that OPEC's February output was below its self-imposed quota of 15.8 mln barrels per day.     Firmer gas oil on the London futures, and more bullish sentiment on the New York Mercantile Exchange futures market are supporting spot price levels, they said.      Another Japanese trading house has paid the official price but through a processing arrangement will effectively receive a discount, the sources said. "It's just disguised cheating," one Japanese trader said.     The sources said only one Japanese company had paid the official price for Iranian oil. It has purchased 1.5 mln barrels of Iranian Heavy for April shipment for refining in Singapore. They said about nine VLCCs of Iranian crude have been sold to Western traders with pricing based 60 pct on the official price and 40 pct on spot prices, or with part of the price related to processing arrangements.  ;

TEST; 9-MAR-1987 10:47:32.75;U.K. ISSUES ONE BILLION STG BOND TRANCHE;  The Bank of England said it was taking onto its books a further one billion stg tranche of 8-3/4 pct Treasury Loan stock due 1997, payable 40 stg pct on application. The stock was issued to the Bank at 96.50 stg pct and will be available for dealings from March 11, with the remainder of the amount payable on May 5. The Bank said the bonds would yield 9.28 pct at the issue price and would be free of tax to residents overseas. The issue would be designated 8-3/4 pct Treasury Loan 1997 "B."  A further 100 mln stg was reserved for the National Debt Commissioners.     The market dropped by up to 1/2 point following the Bank's announcement, with the Treasury 13-1/2 pct stock due 2004/08 quoted one full point lower at 134-12/32 stg pct around 20 minutes after the news.     Dealers said the announcement had to be viewed against the backdrop of intense pressure for lower U.K. Interest rates which had built up over the past two weeks as a result of sterling's strength.     The Bank this morning finally signalled it was prepared to see lower rates and U.K. Clearing banks this afternoon announced cuts in their base lending rates to 10.5 pct from 11 pct.     The Bank had initially been reluctant to countenance a rate cut because, dealers said, the authorities had wished to delay a reduction until around the time of the U.K. Budget on March 17, thereby preserving the full impact of Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's package of measures.     However, in the face of sterling's apparently inexorable climb, the authorities today decided to cede to pressure and allow a half-point cut.     Today's one billion stg tap issue was viewed by the market as a move by the Bank to eradicate hopes for a further early rate cut which might arise as a result of strong sterling.     Most market participants believe that Lawson will now foster a further half point interest rate reduction at the time of the budget, although one or two said they would not be surprised to see a full point decline at this stage.     Dealers noted that as part of the authorities' attempts last week to ease pressure for lower rates, the Bank had issued a one billion stg tap stock with a view to subduing the Government bond market.     To the surprise of most participants, the issue was sold out within hours of becoming available for trading and the market pushed on to register further sharp gains.     Dealers said that at this stage it seemed unlikely that the issue announced today would be absorbed by the market as rapidly as last week's.     However, they noted that although sterling had edged down from its highs following the base rate cut, it had still closed on a trade-weighted basis at 72.4, well ahead of Friday's final 71.8 and only just beneath the peak of 72.5 touched at 1300 GMT.

TEST; 9-MAR-1987 10:50:26.32;CHARAN SEES AT LEAST 50 PCT RISE IN 1987 PROFIT;  (Charan Industries Inc), a distributor of toys and other consumer products, expects 1987 net profit to rise at least 50 pct over last year's 6.1 mln dlrs, president Earl Takefman told reporters before the annual meeting.     "We grew basically 100 pct last year, I'm not sure we're going to be able to grow 100 pct again this year but we certainly will grow at least 50 pct over last year," Takefman said.     Charan reported profit of 3.0 mln dlrs in 1985.     Takefman said he expects sales to rise to about 100 mln dlrs this year from 57.3 mln dlrs in 1986.     Fiscal 1985 ended September 30, while fiscal 1986 ended November 30.     Takefman said the company is actively looking for acquisitions in the consumer products industry, likely in Canada.     The company said it expects to resolve delivery problems this year which last year hindered the growth of its toy distribution business, which accounts for about one-third of revenues.     Charan is the exclusive distributor in Canada for <Worlds of Wonder> toys, which include the Teddy Ruxpin voice-activated talking plush bear.     Takefman said new products this year, which will be on the shelves for Christmas, include a smaller version of Teddy Ruxpin, a talking Mickey Mouse toy, dancing plush toys, a doll with a voice activated by sound, touch, light and heat, and talking books.     The company is also marketing an extended line of "laser tag" kits, which shoot rays of light and tell you when you've hit someone.     Other products include a recorder device which allows students to leave taped messages in each others' school lockers, retailing for about 60 dlrs.  Reuter ;

"It's a reasonable deal for both sides," the analyst told Reuters.     "Chrysler gets the jeep franchise and the (new AMC) Bramalea, Ontario, plant and the (new Renault) Premier (mid-sized car) and AMC's sales will go up because buyers will have more confidence that the manufacturer will still be around to service the products," Glantz said.

TEST; 9-MAR-1987 13:32:01.77;USX <X> CHAIRMAN CALLS FOR LOWER DOLLAR;  USX Corp chairman David Roderick called for a lower value for the U.S. dollar against other currencies to help speed a correction in the U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 170 billion dlrs.     In remarks prepared for a speech before the Economic Club of Detroit, Roderick said, "There should be total resolve that the dollar versus other major currencies, as well as the currencies of other nations having a substantial trade surplus with us, must continue to decline so that the correction in our trade deficit starts on the road to recovery."     Roderick said the U.S. should be understanding of the "economic pain" our trading partners experience as a result of a falling dollar.     But, he added, "As painful as the correction may be to our trading partners, it is less painful than leaving the problem uncorrected because that would lead us into an inevitable, lengthy and steep world recession."     Roderick said between February 1985 and December 1986 the dollar fell by more than 40 pct in real terms against major industrial currencies and by 30 to 35 pct against a broader group of currencies of nearly all developing nations.     At the end of 1986, he said, the value of foreign assets in the U.S. exceeded the value of U.S. assets abroad by 240 billion dlrs, compared to five years ago when the U.S. had a surplus in assets of 141 billion. A company spokesman said the data were provided by economic consultants to USX.     The primary reason for the trade imbalance was the 70 pct rise of the dollar between 1980 and 1985, although other factors were involved, Roderick said. But it is wrong, he said, "to attribute the massive trade deficit to a fundmental deterioration of U.S. productivity or of American product quality."     These areas need to be improved but they are not the root cause of the trade gap problem, Roderick said. He urged American manufacturers to become more competitive so they can compete in global markets.     In the speech, the USX chairman also called for changes in securities laws to curb what he called abuses by corporate raiders and speculators.     Among his proposals, which he presented to the Senate Banking Committee in testimony last week, were a requirement that raiders give 24-hour notice for every one pct of stock they acquire in a company.     Roderick proposed that tender offers must be made for all cash to all stockholders on equal terms and that raiders be required to have financing in place before a tender is made.     Further, raiders should be required to make an all-cash tender offer once they acquire 10 pct of a target company's stock, he said. And payment of greenmail, or a preferential price by a target company to buy back a raider's stake, should be prohibited under the revised laws.     Roderick said changes were necessary to curb abuses but that he did not want laws that would hurt the financial markets or discourage "fair price to all" takeovers.  Reuter ;

Sergey Frolov, chief economist at Amtorg Trading Corp, an agent for Soviet trade organisations and industries, told a U.S.-USSR business meeting the Soviet Union produces few items that western nations want.     But reforms, including upgrading the quality of goods and allowing joint ventures with foreign firms, will encourage modest export gains in future.     Frolov said the Soviet Union exported 500 mln dlrs worth of goods to the United States in 1986 and imported 1.5 billion dlrs worth. He gave no trade forecast for 1987.     But he said that even if all obstacles were removed, total trade between the two countries would remain between two and three billion dlrs a year.     "The post-detente embargoes have taught the USSR to limit its trading with the U.S.," he said.  REUTER ;

The official Iraqi news agency INA said the attack was repelled yesterday by the Fifth Army Corps' 96th Brigade on "Karda Ku" peak, overlooking the northern post of Haj Omran and 340 kms north of Baghdad.     INA said hundreds of Iranians were killed and large quantities of armour and weapons were left behind. It did not give Iraqi casualties.     The Iranian news agency IRNA said yesterday that Iraqi troops had suffered 3,000 casualties in Iran's week-old offensive in northeast Iraq.     Iran attacked across snow-capped peaks of northeastern Iraq last week in an area which saw heavy fighting in mid-1983.     The thrust followed fierce battles near Basra, Iraq's second city on the southern front of the 6-1/2-year-old conflict, after an Iranian cross-border offensive launched on January 9.     The political department head at Iraq's Defence Ministry, Abdul Jabbar Muhsen, said on Monday fighting was continuing in the north but that Iran had exaggerated battle reports.     He said Tehran had done this "to make up for failure in the south and to encourage anti-Baghdad Kurdish rebels to support its troops."

TEST;11-MAR-1987 10:50:03.34;NAKASONE SET TO STAY UNTIL TAX REFORM APPROVED;     By Yuko Nakamikado, Reuters Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will step down only after his plan to overhaul Japan's tax system gets parliamentary approval, one of his closest aides said today.     The aide, who declined to be identified, said at a private meeting, "Nakasone's power in office does not necessarily terminate at the end of his term in October. It depends on when (the) seven tax reform bills get parliamentary approval."     Nakasone vowed yesterday to press on with his plan despite Sunday's unexpected Upper House by-election defeat of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in a conservative stronghold.     The socialist winner, backed by other opposition parties, had campaigned against a controversial five pct value added sales tax, the main plank of the reform plans.     The aide dismissed the possibility of any amendment of the sales tax on the grounds the opposition parties were demanding nothing but retraction of the tax.     They have been refusing to discuss a draft budget for the 1987 fiscal year starting on April 1, which includes the tax plans. They have been resorting to an on-off boycott of parliament since February 4.    "If I were Nakasone, I would close the current regular parliamentary session on May 27 as scheduled, attend the Venice summit of industrial democracies in June and open an extraordinary session to discuss the tax plans," the aide said.     Under law, a regular session can be extended only once while an extraordinary session can be extended twice.The other option would be to extend the current session, he said.     "The opposition parties will surely present a no-confidence motion against the Nakasone Cabinet at one stage or another."     One scenario then will be to reject the motion opening up the way for tax reform.    "Another scenario is the resignation of the Nakasone Cabinet en masse. A third scenario is a dissolution of the Lower House for a snap general election," the aide said.     That is only possible if the 200 opposition members resign from the 512-seat Lower House, necessitating by-elections.     The LDP now has 304 seats in the Lower House after its landslide victory in general elections last July.     There are five independents and three vacancies.     "The LDP which will put up candidates will certainly inflate their seats, but at the expense of fierce media criticism," the aide said.     He said he expected the proposed sales tax to have little effect on local elections to be held on April 12 and 26.     About 2,600 elections will be held in all but three of the nation's 47 prefectures including 13 gubernatorial elections.     "Candidates running in prefectural assemblies will all oppose the sales tax irrespective of their party tickets.     "Possible effects, if any, will be on gubernatorial elections in Japan's northernmost island of Hokkaido and Fukuoka in southern Japan," he said.     The two posts are now held by opposition socialists.  REUTER ;

"I am very impressed with the strong basic earnings story," analyst Smith said, noting that the company has "fine tuned its buying and inventories, and has admirably controlled costs in a time that they needed to."     The stock jumped 2-1/2 to 98-3/4.     Smith said the company ended 1986 with a strong cash position of about 639 mln dlrs as compared to 158 mln dlrs the year before. "This implies the possibility of a share buyback, or significant dividend increase or a stock split," he said.     In addition, he said the company has been gradually adjusting its merchandise mix and its gross margins have been improving.     Smith expects the company to earn 8.25-to-8.50 dlrs a share in 1987 as compared to the 7.06 dlrs a share earned last year. Last year's results include a 69 cent charge for the buyback of debt.

TEST;11-MAR-1987 12:46:36.41;BELGIAN MINISTER UNVEILS PRIVATISATION PLAN;  Belgian Budget Minister Guy Verhofstadt has proposed a plan to sell off shares in several state-owned enterprises, including national airline Sabena and the postal and telecommunications authority, government sources said.     They said the plan could raise more than 25 billion francs in revenue over the next five years according to Verhofstadt's projections, helping the government to reduce its huge budget deficit, targetted this year at 418 billion francs.     But the scheme had received a guarded reception from the Social Christian parties in Belgium's centre-right coalition when Verhofstadt unveiled it at a cabinet meeting yesterday.     Discussion of the plan was likely to be long and difficult, the sources said.     Verhofstadt proposes beginning the selloffs in the last quarter of 1987, with the sale of 30 to 40 pct of state investment company SNI. He expects the sale to raise three billion francs, they added.     A 25 pct share in Sabena would be sold in mid-1989 for 1.5 billion francs, while 50 pct of the postal and telecommunications authority would be sold off in two stages in mid-1990 and early 1992, raising at least seven billion francs.     Also on Verhofstadt's list are the Maritime Transport Authority, leading gas distributor Distrigaz, CGER savings bank, CGER, and several other credit institutions.

Enrollment will be in the range of seven to 12 mln acres, USDA conservation specialists said. Total enrollment so far in the 10-year conservation program is 8.9 mln acres.     Producers submitted bids to enter 11 to 12 mln acres into the program, Milton Hertz, administrator for USDA's Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service said at a congressional hearing yesterday. Not all the bids will be accepted, Hertz said, but enrollment is expected to be high.     As in the first three signups, the Great Plains area is expected to attract the greatest enrollment.     "The Great Plains area will be the predominate area which we'll get signup in," a USDA conservation specialist said.     Marginal corn acreage will likely be the bulk of the acreage pulled from that area, he said.     Fringe soybean acres in the southeast and some bean acreage in the midwest are also expected to be taken out of production, but the USDA source said this would be a relatively small percent of the total.     A special two dlr bonus to corn producers who enroll part of their corn base acreage into the program has sparked more interest in this latest signup, USDA officials said.     Under the program, USDA pays farmers annual rents to take land out of production for 10 years. The average rent payment accepted in the first three signups was 43.50 dlrs per acre.  Reuter ;
TEST;11-MAR-1987 17:19:46.86;MORE HEAVY RAINS IN ARGENTINE GRAIN AREAS;     By Manuel Villanueva, Reuters Heavy rains fell again in Argentina's main grain growing areas in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.     Rains fell heaviest early in the week, and in particularly high volume in Buenos Aires province, Cordoba, La Pampa and Santa Fe provinces.     Rainfall totalled between 20 and 290 mm in Buenos Aires, heaviest in western sectors of the province, 20 to 145 mm in La Pampa, 25 to 120 mm in Cordoba, and 10 to 75 mm in Santa Fe. Rainfall was lighter in other provinces.     Rainfall totalled from five to 50 mm in Corrientes, five to 31 mm in San Luis, five to 30 mm in Entre Rios, three to 20 mm in Misiones, 11 to 17 mm in Formosa and one to eight mm in Chaco.     Growers said it was still too early to tell whether the rains had damaged crops, though they said maize and sunflower crops may have suffered.     Harvesting of both those crops and sorghum was paralysed by the bad weather. For harvesting to resume as normal, the rains would have to stop long enough for the soil to dry and allow farm machinery to operate.     The rains caused flooding in western and northwestern Buenos Aires, as more than 750 mm have fallen in some areas there since February 23 while the annual average is 1,200 mm.     Flooded areas total between 1.2 and 1.5 mln hectares, Buenos Aires province governor Alejandro Armendariz said after flying over the flooded area.     Agriculture Secretary Ernesto Figueras said only 500,000 hectares of the area now flooded had been planted, and that 200,000 to 300,000 hectares could be lost. Growers said large parts of the flooded areas were not planted because they are low-lying and flood easily.     Trade sources said it was certain crops were damaged by the heavy rains but it was too early to tell the exact extent of the damage. They said it was likely rain combined with high winds uprooted many sunflower and maize plants.     The sunflower harvest moved forward in the centre and south of Cordoba and Santa Fe and got underway in a few isolated areas of northern Buenos Aires. Growers have harvested between 15 and 18 pct of total planted area, up from seven to nine pct a week ago.     Estimates of the total volume of the sunflower crop were revised downward in light of the bad weather.     Estimates for total crop ranged from 2.3 to 2.6 mln tonnes, down from 2.4 to 2.7 mln tonnes estimated last week and down 34.1 to 41.5 pct from last year's record harvest of 4.1 mln tonnes.     Maize harvesting also advanced, reaching between 13 and 15 pct of total planted area compared to seven to nine pct a week ago. The maize harvest is expected to total between 10 and 10.2 mln tonnes, down from the 10 to 10.4 mln tonnes estimated a week ago.     Last year's maize harvest totalled 12.8 mln tonnes, according to official figures.     Soybean production estimates were revised downward, to 7.8 to 8.2 mln tonnes compared to estimates of eight to 8.4 mln tonnes a week ago. Last year's soybean harvest totalled 7.1 mln tonnes, according to official figures.     Sorghum harvesting moved slowly forward, reaching between four and six pct of total planted area, compared to two to four pct a week ago.     Sorghum production estimates remained steady at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes, down 16.7 to 22 pct from the 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest.  Reuter ;

Murakhovsky, who is also chairman of the State Agro-Industrial Committee (GOSAGROPROM), told a news conference he had discussed a variety of possible deals with French companies Rhone-Poulenc, Pechiney and Imec.     Declining to put figures on possible contracts he said he had discussed plant protection and the processing of highly sulphuric gas with Rhone-Poulenc, packaging technology for agricultural products with Pechiney, and fruit and vegetable juice processing with Imec.     An official for Pechiney said an agreement of intent on packaging could be signed soon, but could not give any other details. The other two companies were not immediately available for comment.

At a meeting in Paris last January French and Soviet foreign trade ministers said they were committed to increased efforts to reduce the deficit. Estimates at the time showed a French 190 mln franc surplus for December 1986.     Murakhovsky said the Soviet Union was prepared to talk with anybody with "interesting" proposals offering latest technology and assuring "a mutual advantage."     He said the Soviet Union had many tasks ahead of it and would deal rapidly with proposals it considered interesting.     He encouraged companies to take advantage of new laws guaranteeing "the interests of foreign partners" in joint ventures.     But he said no agreements had yet been finalised under the new joint venture laws.     He said concrete deals had not yet been finalised as a result of a one billion dollar accord signed in Moscow last month with French businessman Jean-Baptiste Doumeng.     He said Doumeng's Interagra company was preparing proposals for further examination by the Soviet Union. Doumeng last month said the agreement was to exchange one billion dollars worth of goods.     Murakhovsky said the agreement was one of intent, and designed primarily to renew and increase the Soviet Union's food production capacity.  Reuter ;
TEST;11-MAR-1987 19:15:32.68;BRITAIN CALLS ON JAPAN TO INCREASE IMPORTS;  Britain today called on Japan to increase foreign imports or risk the rise of protectionism and the harm it would bring to it and other trading nations.     British Trade and Industry Secretary Paul Channon said Japan must heed a report issued by a Japanese government advisory body in December calling for faster domestic demand to help cut its trade surplus and restructure its economy.     "I recognise that the strong yen has brought problems to Japan's domestic economy," he told a group of Japanese businessmen in London.     "But these short term difficulties should not be allowed to deflect Japan from the fundamental reforms necessary," he said.     "It is not just a domestic issue for Japan. If import propensity does not expand very soon there is a real risk from protectionist lobbies, particularly in the U.S. With whom Japan has so massive a surplus," he said.     "They may well succeed in securing action by governments which would be highly injurious to trading nations like Japan and the U.K."     Channon said there had been substantial growth in the volume of trade between Japan and Britain, amounting to 6.2 billion sterling (9.8 billion dlrs) last year.     But he added: "Regrettably too much of it was in one direction, with the Japanese selling us 3.7 billion sterling (5.8 billion dlrs) more than we sold them."  Reuter ;

The officials told reporters Baldrige had serious concerns on national security grounds about the sale of Schlumberger Ltd <SLB> unit <Fairchild Semiconductor Inc> to Fujitsu Ltd <ITSU.T>. The officials said the sale could leave the United States overly dependent on a foreign company for equipment used in advanced missiles, aircraft electronics and intelligence gathering.     The U.S. Officials added the sale would also worsen the strained relations between the two countries stemming from the huge Japanese trade surplus.

TEST;12-MAR-1987 03:24:08.77;STRIKING BRAZIL SEAMEN THREATEN MASS RESIGNATION;     By Stephen Powell, Reuters Striking seamen said they would offer their collective resignation rather than end their 13-day-old national strike on management's terms.     The seamen said they were spurred to their decision after marines occupied the ship Docemarte in Santos harbour Tuesday night. They said seamen on the vessel were being forced to work under duress.     President Jose Sarney's government despatched troops to Brazil's ports and oil installations on Tuesday.     Seamen in Santos, Brazil's main port, are in defiant mood. One of their leaders, Orlando dos Santos, told Reuters that most of the 1,100 seamen in the port offered their resignations on Wednesday. The national strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro said seamen were offering to resign in all the country's main ports.     The strike by 40,000 seamen comes as Brazil faces a serious debt crisis brought on by a sharp deterioration in its trade balance. The country needs all the foreign exchange it can get, and shipowners have been quick to denounce seamen for the harm the strike is doing to exports.     An advertisement placed in the newspapers by the Shipowners Association read, "The seamen's strike is illegal, irrational and unpatriotic."     The seamen respond that they cannot live on their present salaries. According to officical pay lists available in the union's office, the basic pay for ordinary seamen is 1,977 cruzados a month, while various allowances can bring their total pay up to 4,000 cruzados a month.     At the other end of the scale, captains earn 7,993 cruzados a month basic pay, which is brought up to 15,229 cruzados with allowances.      "Brazil's seamen are the second worst paid in the world, after Ghana's," dos Santos said. He said the seamen had not received a pay increase since February 1986, and prices have doubled since then with the collapse of the government's Cruzado Plan price freeze.     Talks in Rio de Janeiro Wednesday involving Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto, seamen and employers failed to resolve the dispute. The seamen are demanding pay raises of about 200 pct but have been offered less than half that.  REUTER ;

This compares with a 1.5 billion deficit in 1985, and while it is the first surplus since 1979, is substantially lower than the 50 billion surplus forecast by the previous socialist government before they lost office in March last year.     Net long-term capital outflows rose sharply to 70.5 billion francs last year from 8.8 billion in 1985, largely due to a major program of foreign debt repayment, the ministry said.     In the fourth quarter alone the unadjusted surplus rose to 14.1 billion francs from 6.6 billion the previous quarter, but the adjusted surplus fell to 7.4 billion from 9.1 billion.

TEST;12-MAR-1987 10:11:41.06;ROCKEFELLER SAYS BRAZIL SOLUTION WILL BE FOUND;  David Rockefeller, chairman of the international advisory committee of Chase Manhattan Bank NA, said an accommodation would be found between Brazil and its commercial bank creditors to solve the problem of the nation's recent interest payment halt.     "I think one will find that the banking community, the Brazilian government and the international banking authorities will be talking for the next several weeks and I am very hopeful that we would find an accommodation." Rockefeller told bankers at a luncheon.     Brazil announced on February 20 that it was suspending interest repayments on about 68 billion dlrs of private sector debt owed to commercial banks.     Rockefeller said the recent tour by Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro of major industrial nations was a sign that Brazil wanted to be cooperative. But it was notable that Funaro did not meet with the creditors immediately affected, the commercial bankers, he added.     Brazil's moratorium on commercial debt becomes critical by end-May, when payments would be 90 days overdue, obliging U.S. Regulators to downgrade Brazilian debt, financial sources said.     This would require banks in turn to cease accruing interest and set aside expensive loan loss reserves.     Rockefeller reminded bankers of the depth of concern over Latin American debt at the Toronto World Bank/International Monetary Fund meeting in 1982, and said an accord would be reached in the current circumstances just as it had been then.     "(Brazilian authorities) have no more interest in seeing their credit sources cut off then we have in seeing their obligations stop," he added.  REUTER ;
TEST;12-MAR-1987 10:18:49.48;PHILLIPS <P> TO EMPHASIZE CASH FLOW TO PARE DEBT;     By Ted D'Afflisio, Reuters Phillips Petroleum Co will emphasize improving its short-term cash flow this year to pare its debt, C.J. "Pete" Silas, chairman, told Reuters in an interview.     "Our priority is to get cash flow increased from the assets already installed," he said, but he declined to estimate annual cash flow for 1987.     Analysts estimate Phillips" cash flow at over one billion dlrs for 1987, while long term debt, which resulted from restructuring to find off corporate raiders in 1985, hovers about 5.9 billion dlrs as of December 1986.      Silas said Phillips hope to achieve its goal by raising the capital expenditures budget to develop its oil and gas properties.     "We plan to develop the properties with short-term high cash flow prospects," he said. He projected a capital expenditure budget of 730 mln dlrs, up from the 1986 expenditure of 655 mln dlrs.     Nearly half of that will be spent on exploration and production, and most of that will be spend overseas, Silas said.     "Phillips' top priority in 1987 will be to get the waterflooding in Norway and jack up the (Ekofisk) oil fields to improve our ability to extract oil and increase earnings," Silas said.      Phillips estimates that the project, which is expected to cost 1.5 billion dlrs, will increase recovery by 170 mln gross barrels of oil over a period of 24 years.     Phillips is also pursue opportunities in China where Silas said he was seeking "a modification of terms with the Chinese government to make oil discoveries (in the offshore Xijang fields) commercially viable."     In the U.S. Silas said Phillips hopes to get the Point Arguello, Calif., field started up by the fourth quarter. "We expect to start up the first platform then," Silas said.     But emphasis on short-term cash flow has also forced the company to part with several oil and gas assets.     Phillips sold its interests in the T-Block in the U.K. North Sea and U.S. reserves totaling about 1.3 billion dlrs in 1986 as part of a two billion dlrs asset sales program that is now completed, Silas said.      "We sold high cost producing assets. They were not good value for us but possibly so for someone else," Silas said.     Silas said the 1986 assets sales will not affect earnings for the company.     "Everything we are doing is to manage our cash flow and we are using that to manage our debt. Even the asset sales, while regrettable, were necessary to reduce debt," Silas said.     He said no asset sales are planned this year as long as oil prices don't fall sharply lower and stay at lower levels  for several months. "Then, everyone would be looking at sales (of assets), and we're no different from the others," Silas said.     In other areas, Silas looks for improved earnings from Phillips chemical operations, which provided 299 mln dlrs in earnings for 1986, up from 219 mln dlrs in 1985.     "This was our second best year pushed by a good supply and demand balance for products, low feedstocks and energy costs for our operations," Silas said, "In 1987 we think the market's supply and demand balance will be just as good but feedstock and energy costs will rise due to price recovery."

TEST;12-MAR-1987 10:59:14.45;NO NEAR TERM BRAZIL COFFEE MOVES EXPECTED;     By Richard Jarvie, Reuters The Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, is unlikely to disclose its future export policy until the end of next week at the earliest, trade sources said.     IBC president Jorio Dauster is meeting government ministers, producers, exporters and market analysts to assess Brazil's position in the light of the failure of talks in London earlier this month to set new International Coffee Organization, ICO, export quotas.     "The failure of the talks means Brazil has got to rethink its position completely," one Santos exporter said.     A meeting of the National Coffee Policy Council is set for Thursday, March 19, and Dauster will almost certainly explain his plan to members then before announcing any new measures.     Dauster told reporters on his return from London last week that no decisions would be made on exports before he had held talks with all sectors of the industry.     Exporters said Dauster is not under any great pressure to start marketing coffee immediately. World prices have been recovering from the lows which followed the collapse of the ICO talks and Brazil has sold a reasonable 5.5 mln bags of 60 kilos for export in the first four months of this year.     The exporters said the key factor in the eventual opening of May and June export registrations will be the amount at which the contribution quota is set.     With little expectation of other sales incentive mechanisms such as discounts, bonuses and price fall guarantees being introduced, the level of the quota will be decisive in determining the competitiveness of Brazilian coffee on world markets, they said.     They noted that on February 16, the eve of a planned increase in the quota, April registrations were opened and closed after 1.68 mln bags were registered for export, a record amount for a single day.     If May/June registrations are opened under similar conditions as before, Brazil would have no difficulty in selling at least 2.0 mln bags per month.     "The problem would be how to limit sales," one exporter said.     Brazil's present foreign trade and payments problems mean there are pressures from the government to boost exports to maximise foreign exchange earnings.     However, the sources said they expect the IBC to adopt a marketing strategy aimed at regaining Brazil's dominant position as an exporter, but without causing a price war.     General opinion among exporters was that Brazil would plan to export between 17 and 18 mln bags this year of which between 1.5 and 2.0 mln would be to non-members of the ICO.     The 15.5 mln to 16 mln bags sold to members would be around the figure Brazil had offered to ship if ICO quotas were reintroduced, although Dauster has said this offer expired with the breakdown of talks.     With the prospects of a crop of at least 28 mln bags this year, Brazil has the capacity to export up to 20 mln bags after meeting local consumption of around 7.0 mln, the sources added.     However, the sources said Brazil is unlikely even to consider exporting such quantities, as this would almost inevitably lead to a fall in world prices as Brazil tried to encroach on other producers' markets.     Maximum export earnings would be achieved by orderly marketing of traditional amounts, thus re-establishing Brazil's market share after last year's unusually low exports of 9.9 mln bags, enabling it to rebuild stocks and maintaining cordial relations with the producer group which backed Brazil's stance at the ICO talks, they added.

He said the process of restoring external balance to the U.S. economy requires dealing with the budget deficit.

TEST;12-MAR-1987 16:21:45.01;CARGILL OFFICIAL DEFENDS CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS;  The use of generic in-kind commodity certificates has helped ease storage problems and is a necessary part of export promotion programs, a senior executive for the world's largest grain company said.     Testifying before the House Agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains, Robbin Johnson, vice president of Cargill, Inc., disputed claims that U.S. grain companies have made huge profits from certificate trading.     "The certs program is not in any way a windfall to the trade," he said. Johnson said that Cargill has been dealing with a two pct spread in certificate transactions, and that this is within the normal grain marketing levels.     Johnson recognized current concern over the cost of certificates as compared to cash, but said that critics need to look more closely at the savings caused by certs, noting for example that widespread use of certs in the PIK and Roll marketing technique last summer helped ease storage costs.     Certificates are also an important part of any export promotion program, he said.     "The more you look at ways to expand export markets, the more you have to look at ways to expand certs to put more grain into the market to meet demand," he said.     Subcommittee chairman Dan Glickman (D-Kans.) said his committee would be looking at the certificate program later this year and studying the General Accounting Office report on certificate costs.

TEST;12-MAR-1987 16:42:41.29;U.S. MARKET LOAN NOT THAT ATTRACTIVE-BOSCHWITZ;  A marketing loan for U.S. wheat, feedgrains and soybeans would do nothing to help the surplus production situation and would be extremely costly, Sen.

Boschwitz was one of the original supporters of a marketing loan for cotton and rice, but has since focused support on decoupling legislation, the Boren/Boschwitiz bill.

TEST;12-MAR-1987 18:32:12.03;FED DATA INDICATE NO POLICY CHANGE LIKELY;     By Martin Cherrin, Reuters U.S. bank reserve, monetary and discount window borrowings data released by the Federal Reserve today clearly indicate that policy is "on hold" and may not be changed for weeks or even months, economists said.     "The Fed is keeping policy at dead center and it is not about to change policy unless something fairly dramatic occurs on the economy," said John Williams of Bankers Trust Co.     "These numbers contain no hint that a policy shift is in prospect, nor do economic or financial developments argue for policy change," said William Griggs of Griggs and Santow Inc.     Fed data released today were all in line with economists' expectations and similar to the numbers of recent weeks.     The Fed said net discount window borrowings in the two weeks ended Wednesday averaged 191 mln dlrs, up from 381 mln dlrs in the February 25 statement period, but little changed from 160 mln dlrs in the period before that.     It said that banks' net free reserves in the latest two weeks averaged 660 mln dlrs versus 675 mln dlrs previously.     Finally, the Fed said that the M-1 money supply fell 800 mln dlrs in February, with the broader M-2 measure down 1.6 billion dlrs and M-3 up an even three billion dlrs.     Analysts said that M-1 last month grew at a negative 1.3 pct annual rate compared with minus 0.7 pct for M-2 and actual positive growth of 1.0 pct annualized for M-3.     February levels of M-2 and M-3 left the aggregates 18.2 and 20.8 billion dlrs under their respective upper growth limits set by the Fed for 1987. The annual growth target for both is 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct. There is no M-1 target.     "In the near term, there is absolutely no reason for the Fed to ease policy, even apart from the slowdown in money growth," said Stephen Slifer, economist at Lehman Government Securities Inc.     Economists generally expect a modest pickup in monetary growth in March after February's anemic growth rates. However, they stress that money growth will not be strong enough to prevent the Fed from dropping interest rates further if the economy shows evidence of weakness.     Commenting on February's decline in the key M-2 aggregate, Slifer said the main cause was a 3.2 billion dlr drop in money market deposits at banks. This number has risen three to four billion dlrs a month for a long while, he said, so February's weakness is not likely to persist. Slifer expects modest M-2 and M-3 growth rates of 3-1/2 to four pct during March.     Griggs said that M-2 and M-3 in coming months should return to the five to seven pct annualized growth region and so continue to present no problem for the Fed.     Economists said the Fed appears to be very comfortable with its current policy stance and it is likely to wait for perhaps several more months of economic data before deciding whether or not to ease its grip on reserves.     Given the economy's fragility in many sectors, the analysts agreed that there is almost no chance that the Fed will choose to raise, rather than lower, interest rates when it next changes policy.     "Discount window borrowings in the past week were about as low as the Fed can get them, although Fed funds held above six pct," said Williams of Bankers Trust. Funds averaged 6.12 pct in the week to Wednesday, up from 6.06 pct in the prior week.     The Fed added reserves indirectly via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements last Friday, 2.5 billion dlrs on Monday and two billion dlrs on Wednesday. On Tuesday, it added reserves directly through two-day System repurchases.     Williams and Griggs agreed the Fed will let the funds rate be largely market-driven. They said it is focusing instead on a borrowings target of around 300 mln dlrs.  Reuter ;
TEST;12-MAR-1987 18:33:57.62;COLOMBIA'S COFFEE MARKETING TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE;  Colombia intends to improve the marketing of its coffee with the accent on more flexibility on setting export registration prices, finance minister Cesar Gaviria said.     Speaking to reporters after announcing a lower export registration price, or reintegro, of 1.10 dlr per lb ex-dock New York, Gaviria said export mechanisms would be more agile.     "In the first stage, we decided not only to lower the reintegro but also to adopt a flexible policy of reintegro that will allow private exporters to participate more actively in Colombia's coffee export policy," he said.     Traders said this means the export registration price will change more often in a truer reflection of market trends.     Gaviria said the measures merely responded to new market factors since a return to a system of International Coffee Organisation (ICO) export quotas may not occur in the short term.     ICO talks last month in London failed to break a deadlock over re-introduction of export quotas, suspended in February 1986.     Gaviria stressed that Colombia will not necessarily suffer from depressed prices because it can compensate lower prices with increased volume.     "Colombia will continue to export its traditional amount of coffee, between 9.6 and 10 mln bags (of 60 kilos), and will do so without an agreement among producers," he said.     He ruled out a much higher volume of exports, or up to 13.5 mln bags as mentioned in market circles, "because the idea is precisely not to disrupt the market."     Colombia exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86 coffee year which ended last September 30.     Echoing Gaviria's words, Jorge Cardenas, manager of the national coffee growers' federation, said Colombia sought to adapt its coffee marketing policy to circumstances.     "There is great expectation in the world for the policies that Brazil and Colombia will adopt. Ours is beginning to emerge and no agreement among producers is foreseeable in the immediate future," he told journalists.     Trade sources in Rio today said Brazil's future export policy was unlikely to be revealed before the end of next week.     Cardenas said a new ICO meeting could only take place when problems that hindered an agreement at the recent London talks have been resolved.     Asked to comment on a Reuter report from Jakarta saying Indonesia hoped Colombia could use its contacts with Brazil to suggest a compromise on the quota issue, Cardenas said the Brazilian stand was quite clear.     He said Brazil's current quota "reflects the reality of the market, allows for an orderly supply and satisfies demand," but added more clarity was needed to assess the criteria that determined it.     Cardenas said lows registered immediately after the failure of the London talks were triggered by a widespread fear among dealers of an imminent price war and the belief that producers would go out and sell their coffee as quickly as possible, which did not happen.

The eight month old pact aims to stop Japan selling large quantities of chips at knock-down prices to the United States and other countries and to increase U.S. Semiconductor sales in Japan.     The U.S. Senate Finance Committee this week called on President Reagan in a non-binding resolution to retaliate against Japan for violating the agreement.  REUTER ;

Finance Ministry officials declined comment but said the Ministry has been aware of growing calls from securities houses for 10-year bond auctions.     Japanese securities houses also may allow foreign brokers to underwrite more 10-year bonds from April. Four U.S. Banks are expected to receive Finance Ministry approval in late April to operate securities subsidiaries in Japan as long as they hold no more than 50 pct of the capital, bankers said.     These firms are likely to join the syndicate, which will increase the number of participants in the 10-year government bond primary market, securities managers said.     Each of the 17 current foreign securities houses in the syndicate underwrites 0.07 pct of each issue, they said.     In order to expand participation by foreigners, the syndicate must either expand the securities industry's 26 pct share or introduce auctions to the primary market, they said.     Local brokers have requested the head of the syndicate, now Fuji Bank Ltd, to increase their share to 30.7 pct but banks oppose any cut in their 74 pct share, bankers said.  REUTER ;

He described the application as a precautionary move and said no agreement on buying a majority stake had yet been reached. Until now Mannesmann has said only that it wanted to buy a 37.5 pct stake in Fichtel from the heirs of Ernst Wilhelm Sachs, the grandson of the firm's founder.     The spokesman declined to say from whom it may buy the other shares to create a majority stake in the firm.     Fichtel's other principal shareholders are Commerzbank AG <CBKG.F>, with 35.01 pct, and Salzgitter AG <ISLG.F>, with 24.98 pct. Spokesmen declined to comment directly on the possibility of selling Fichtel shares to Mannesmann.     Mannesmann said in January it hoped to take a 37.5 pct stake in Fichtel's holding company Sachs AG in the first quarter.     Last week a spokesman said Mannesmann had a letter of intent on the 37.5 pct stake but completion was being delayed by legal questions surrounding the inheritance.  REUTER ;
TEST;13-MAR-1987 06:24:01.06;ALUSUISSE SEES POSSIBLE BREAK-EVEN IN 1987;  Schweizerische Aluminimum AG <ALUZ.Z> (Alusuisse) may be able to break even this year after cleansing its balance sheet for 1986, chief executive Hans Jucker said.     "The threshold of profitability has returned to the foreseeable future," he said. "We expect already in 1987 approximately to break even. That presupposes, however, that our industrial environment does not worsen."     He said Alusuisse would no longer face the burden of past losses.     Alusuisse made a net loss of 688 mln Swiss francs in 1986 after a restated 756 mln loss in 1985.     Gross sales were 5.93 billion francs after 8.51 billion and net turnover 5.65 billion after 8.00 billion.     Alusuisse had originally reported a 692 mln francs loss for 1985.     But Jucker and Finance Director Hermann Haerri told a news conference the new management installed a year ago had decided to restate the previous five years' accounts to eliminate rights on Australian bauxite previously in the books as an asset.     Together with other one-off charges, Alusuisse took an gross extraordinary charge in 1986 of 698 mln francs, up from 472 mln in 1985.     It also had 106 mln extraordinary income in 1986 remaining, after provisions, from the sale of its Maremont Corp subsidiary in the United States. There were no extraordinary gains in 1985.     Jucker said the losses, plus those carried forward from 1985, had wiped out the company's remaining reserves and exceeded legally allowed levels, forcing Alusuisse to adopt a 50 pct capital cut, to be approved by shareholders on April 22.     Jucker said he knew shareholders would find this "radical elimination of the mortgages of the past" painful, but said the foundation had been laid for a successful new company strategy.     Haerri said despite the losses, the company's liquidity was strong. Bank debt had been cut by about one-third to 2.56 billion francs against the end-1985 level of 3.85 billion.     Cash flow improved substantially to 323 mln francs from 111 mln and represented 5.7 pct of turnover against a mere 1.4 pct in 1985.     In addition, to reassure other creditors, Alusuisse had arranged with three major Swiss banks -- Union Bank of Switzerland <SBGZ.Z>, Swiss Bank Corp <SBVZ.Z> and Credit Suisse <CRSZ.Z>, to convert 300 mln francs of credits into a subordinated loan.     The main sources of losses in 1986 were book losses and not cash losses, Haerri said. Existing credit lines were used only to a small extent, and the parent company had been granted a new credit line of 200 mln francs from a consortium of Swiss banks that would cover most of the loans falling due in 1987.     Haerri said the company had been criticized for maintaining bauxite rights as an asset, and so had restated the accounts.     That left the 1985 account with a 756 mln franc loss instead of 692 mln, 1984 with a 68 mln profit instead of 169 mln, 1983 with a 217 mln loss instead of 82 mln and 1982 with a 479 mln loss instead of 179 mln.     The new accounts show 1985 with shareholders' equity of 1.15 billion francs instead of 1.75 billion, and similar alternations were made for previous years.     After 1986 losses, shareholder's equity stood at only 895 mln francs.  REUTER ;
TEST;13-MAR-1987 06:29:58.03;JAPAN CORPORATE PROFITS IN LAST 1986 QUARTER UP;  Current profits of Japan's major firms in the October-December quarter rose four pct from a year earlier to 5,654 billion yen against a 2.6 pct year-on-year rise in the preceding quarter, the Finance Ministry said.     The improved earnings resulted mainly from a 22.5 pct profit increase in non-manufacturing industries, supported by an 88.7 pct rise for construction firms and a 138 pct gain in real estate, according to a ministry survey.     Total sales of the 15,308 firms with capital of 10 mln yen or more which responded to the poll, fell one pct to 217,217 billion yen against a 1.2 pct fall the previous quarter.     Current profits of manufacturing industries in the fourth quarter dropped 13.7 pct to 2,394 billion yen against a 22.1 pct fall in the preceding quarter, the ministry said.     Plant and equipment investments of all firms polled fell 3.9 pct to 8,004 billion yen, compared with a 1.4 percent fall the previoius quarter.     Ministry officials said the survey showed that the Japanese economy is in a delicate stage in which it is hard to tell if economic growth has stopped deteriorating or if the economy is heading for a recovery.

A VW statement said foreign exchange department chief Burkhard Junger had been dismissed with immediate effect.     It said it has also suspended Guenther Borchert, head of the financial transfer department, and Siegfried Mueller, head of the central cash and currency clearing department. Four other members of the foreign exchange staff were also suspended.     VW said the possibly fraudulent foreign currency transactions, which could cost the company 480 mln marks, fell directly within the area of responsibility of Borchert and Mueller.     VW said Adalbert Sedlmair, formerly finance director at VW's former office equipment subsidiary Triumph-Adler AG, would temporarily take over responsibility of the financial transfer department during Borchert's suspension from duties.     Meanwhile, the state prosecutor's office in Brunswick, which is looking into the currency transactions, said the Federal Criminal Office in Wiesbaden had also joined the investigation and would be responsible for measures such as possible police searches.     A spokeswoman for the office said prosecutors in Frankfurt were looking into the possibility of taking over the VW case but added a final decision would be taken next week.

TEST;13-MAR-1987 13:44:16.50;REAGAN VOWS TO BLOCK TAX HIKE IN HIS PRESIDENCY;  President Reagan told a group of supporters his pledge to veto a tax hike is solid, adding, "There will be no tax rate increase in the 100th Congress."     While he did not mention House Speaker Jim Wright by name, Reagan said that some members of Congress were urging that taxes be raised.     "I'm sorry but that's just not going to happen," said Reagan. "We're not going to break faith with the American people."     "I promise you, tax reform will go ahead as scheduled," the president added. "All these tax hike schemes have as much chance of flying as a dead duck," he said.     Reagan combined his strongly-stated opposition to a tax hike with a warning to Congress to meet the deficit reduction targets set by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget control law.     Failure to do so, he said, would jeopardize a continuation of the current favorable economic climate.      Reuter ;

The spokesman was responding to an enquiry about an item in the London "Standard" newspaper, which said Goldman Sachs "is feared to be the victim of a new multi-million pound City scandal."     The newspaper also said, "The firm (Goldman Sachs) is believed to be the paying agent for some 900 bonds issued in the name of oil giant Exxon which were deposited at banks in Brussels and have now been found to be forgeries."     The spokesman said that the bonds were delivered to the firm by a man working on behalf of a third party. He said it wasn't until the bonds were cleared through Euro-clear (a major clearing house for the eurobond market) that it was discovered they were forgeries.     The spokesman also said he believed that the intermediary had been apprehended by police. However, a spokesman for the City of London police said he was unaware of such an arrest and could neither confirm nor deny it.     Last Friday, Exxon Corp said forgeries of a 20-year zero coupon euronote issued by its Exxon Capital Corp subsidiary have been discovered in the European market.

"The international creditor banks must make their position more flexible, ensuring a flow of funds for Latin American countries, especially the most indebted," Knox told the semi- official newsagency Telam.     Knox said Brazil's decision last month to suspend payments on a large portion of its foreign debt had shocked the creditor banks. The banks were "in no hurry to provide funds for the debtor nations," he said.     But he said the situation of debtor nations transferring funds to the developed should be reversed. "It must be the other way round, to make development in indebted states possible."     He said the World Bank was supplying special lines of credit to make up for this inflexibility on the part of the banks. It had increased its involvement in development projects by 60 pct in the last two years, he said.

Under the deal Petro Chemie supplies oil to Ina refineries in Sisak and Rijeka and ships parts to 12 Yugoslav firms in the petrochemical, chemical, textile and plastics industries. The Yugoslav firms, in turn, will export oil products to France.     Tanjug said this year's exchange will value 530 mln dlrs.     Ina signed a similar deal with West Germany's Hoechst AG <HFAG.F> two years ago.     Ina also has joint ventures and co-production projects, involving Yugoslavia's other main producer <Naftagas> of Novi Sad, with partners in Angola, Algeria and Tunisia, exploring for and exploiting oil and natural gas.     An estimated 300,000 tonnes of oil will thus be obtained from fields in Angola over the next 15 years, Tanjug said.     Ina accounts for some 75 pct of Yugoslavia's total oil production, which amounts to 4.2 mln tonnes a year.     Ina earned more than 154 mln dlrs from exports of goods and services to 39 countries last year and ranks among Yugoslavia's leading export enterprises.     In a separate statement issued through Tanjug, Ina said it has successfully completed the first drill at the depth of over 3,000 meters in the Bay of Baes, in Tunisia. Ina is jointly prospecting with the U.S. Firm Conoco for oil and gas there.     Work on a second drill, below 4,000 meters, would start soon in the Bay of Gabes, the statement said.

TEST;16-MAR-1987 02:28:01.58;VW CURRENCY LOSSES SEEN INVOLVING SEVERAL TRADERS;     By Allan Saunderson, Reuters The extraordinary foreign exchange loss of 480 mln marks reported last week by Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F> (VW) is so large that outside currency traders were probably involved in the case, currency sources said.     They were commenting after weekend newspaper reports that prosecutors were transferring the focus of their enquiries to Frankfurt, West Germany's main foreign exchange centre.     Volkswagen announced last Tuesday that it had called in prosecutors to investigate a possible fraud involving currency hedging.     The newspaper Welt am Sonntag said the investigation by state prosecutors was now considering whether the alleged VW currency manipulators had outside banking accomplices.     The transactions were only possible, "because the culprits possessed genuine bank forms, with the help of which they were able to deceive controllers for years," the newspaper said.     But currency sources said there were so many loopholes in every bank's currency dealing system that controls could easily be avoided.     Rolf Selowsky, financial member of the management board, has resigned in the wake of the affair, a VW spokesman said.     Selowksy's resignation followed a VW announcement on Friday that foreign exchange chief Burkhard Junger had been dismissed and Guenther Borchert, head of the financial transfer department, had been suspended along with Siegfried Mueller, head of the central cash and currency clearing.     Four other members of the foreign exchange staff were also suspended, but no charges have been laid.     VW Supervisory board chairman Karl Gustaf Ratjen said entire data tapes had been erased and programs altered in forged transactions.     Der Spiegel magazine said VW financial controllers discovered the uncovered positions on February 18 when VW expected a currency forward contract with the Hungarian National Bank to mature, but Hungarian bank officials said they knew nothing of the transaction and the supposed contracts were forgeries.     The Budapest-based bank refused to buy the dollars and has not commented on the affair.     The Hungarian National Bank is, along with the Soviet Bank of Foreign Trade, one of two major East Bloc currency traders and most major banks based in Germany deal with it regularly.     It would not be possible, the sources said, for any bank to renege on a genuine forward contract since this would immediately become known and effectively prevent the bank from operating further in the spot or forward currency markets.     Longer-maturity forward contracts, even contracts of up to 10 years, were now becoming more common, they said but the longer and larger the contract, the more likely it was that it would be transacted with a domestic institution.     Being one of Germany's most diversified multi-nationals, VW has exposure in a large number of currencies and dealt in these with most banks in Frankfurt and also abroad, sometimes through currency brokers, although it has the reputation of doing relatively little hedging, currency sources said.     "They (VW) are always in the market, more or less trading as a bank," one senior dealer said.     Some newspaper reports said the losses were incurred because of VW's failure to take out currency hedging contracts beginning at the end of 1984, when the dollar was rising.     But the currency sources said market speculation was that dollar income of around one billion dlrs was involved and that the bulk of the transactions occurred last year since which time around 50 pfennigs per dollar was lost when the dollar fall continued.     Longer-maturity currency contracts for more than 100 or 200 mln dlrs each were rare. Taking several in this size out with a single bank would be easily spotted by financial controllers.     One senior dealer for a German bank said, "There's no way they can have hoped to get away with it. It's too big."     The sources added that the involvement of the Federal Criminal Office (BKA) in Wiesbaden could indicate that the investigation would lead outside Germany.     BKA has the mandate to handle criminal cases that may involve foreign police forces or supranational services such as Interpol. However the branch also handles cases that transcend federal state borders within Germany.  REUTER ;

TEST;16-MAR-1987 04:58:31.59;ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - DUTCH SHARE PROSPECTS MIXED;     By Emma Robson, Reuters While world exchanges revel in a continuing securities boom, the Dutch stockmarket remains lacklustre despite a series of largely positive annual corporate results and signs of a more stable dollar, analysts said.     Prices and turnover on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange have sprung back from lows reached when the dollar dipped below the two guilder mark in January. But market analysts say only lower interest rates or a further rise in the dollar, now trading at around 2.09 guilders, could keep the momentum going.     "Between end-1982 and end-1986 Dutch stocks rose by around 150 pct, but the dollar's sharp fall last year put the brake on the bull market," said Philip Menco, analyst with bank CLN Oyens en van Eeghen.     The dollar's current level compares with an average in 1986 of 2.45 guilders, and 3.35 in 1985, official figures show.     But Arjen Los, analyst with Dutch merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson, sees room for some optimism,    "The market is exaggerating the whole dollar affair. We've seen the bottom of its decline. But what is lacking is a stimulus on the interest rate front," he said.     Analysts said they expected little impact from provincial elections on Wednesday as the government's position was secure.     "The scope for price rises in Dutch shares is narrow, given the limited room for lower interest rates," said Los, adding the Dutch market can currently only dream of returns of around 15 pct seen in rising markets elsewhere in Europe.     "When the dollar slumped in the second half of 1986, U.S. And U.K investors were heavy sellers of Dutch stock. They made an enormous currency gain," Menco said.     Finance Ministry figures show foreign investment in Dutch stock last year fell by nearly half to 4.2 billion guilders.     Los envisaged no significant revival of foreign interest in the Dutch market. He saw the large, liquid Dutch pension funds pursuing a more aggressive portfolio management policy while continuing to invest in markets with weaker currencies.     Outflows of non-bank Dutch capital totalled a record 21.4 billion guilders last year, 12.3 billion of which stemmed from securities transactions.     "Dutch institutions have been rallying to buoyant foreign markets, but this season's results could coax some of them back to the relatively underpriced Dutch market," Koos Ten Have of Staal Bankiers said.     Ten Have said Dutch price/earnings ratios based on forecasts of 1987 results were broadly unchanged compared with 1986. With an average ratio of 10, they were still attractively lower than shares of other exchanges, he added.     He said the reliability of the strong guilder was a further factor favouring Dutch stock investments.     Senior bank economists said this week's official economic forecast by the CPB planning agency painted a gloomy picture of the Dutch economy but this would not shake investor confidence in the Dutch business sector. The Dutch economy was doing relatively well compared with other nations, they added.     Analysts say most companies have fulfilled expectations, while some firms, particularly in food and publishing, surprised the market with continued solid profit growth despite major dollar and sterling investments.     Unexpectedly positive results from companies like Unilever Plc-NV <UN.AS>, NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken <PGLO.AS> and Heineken NV <HEIN.AS> were balanced by poor performances by the three banks, which achieved higher profits partly by reducing their risk provisions. Analysts still have doubts about the insurance sector, and many companies stressed the negative impact of lower currencies on their guilder earnings in 1986.     Food and publishing are seen as major growth areas, despite the fact many of these companies have significant activities in the U.K and U.S.     Food chain Ahold NV <AHLN.AS> reported an 8.1 pct increase in net 1986 profit but said it did not see profits growing in 1987 due to the uncertainty of the dollar.     Turnover declined by 5.7 pct to 11.4 billion guilders. About 1.5 billion guilders of this decline was due to the lower dollar and one third of turnover volume was achieved in the U.S.     "Ahold is too cautious over the dollar," Los said. "As long as such companies continue to maintain their U.S. Activities and fund their expansion there, the negative influence is purely an accounting effect."     Koninklijke Wessanen NV <WESS.AS> and Heineken also managed handsome profit increases of 16.6 and 7.5 pct respectively, while blaming disappointing turnover in their substantial overseas activities on the lower dollar.     Initial publishing results indicate a bumper year for shares in this sector and ensure firm interest despite higher price/earnings ratios, ranging from 12 to 14. REUTER ;
TEST;16-MAR-1987 05:13:28.51;ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - SWISS OPTIONS AND FUTURES;     By Richard Murphy, Reuters Preparations for the launch of a Swiss options and futures exchange, billed as the first completely electronic market of its kind, are at an advanced stage, according to members of the project team.     The Swiss Options and Financial Futures Exchange (Soffex) is a new departure in that it will introduce an additional range of financial instruments and electronic trading methods to the traditionally conservative Swiss market.     There will be no physical exchange floor and both trading and clearing systems will be completely automated.     The new market, due to start operating in January 1988, follows a series of innovations by the bourses in Zurich, Basle and Geneva aimed at preventing loss of business in the face of keen competition from London and Frankfurt.     These innovations included the introduction last October of continuous trading in major shares, plans to establish a single continuously updated Swiss share index from next month to supplement the various indices produced by the major banks at the close of business, and experiments in electronic trading.     Banks themselves last year took the initiative of launching covered warrants on the shares of other Swiss companies.     "If Switzerland wants to maintain and expand its international prominence in portfolio management, our bankers and fund managers must have the same modern instruments at their disposal as their competitors," says Soffex president Rudolf Mueller, a director of Union Bank of Switzerland.     The computer terminals on which business will be conducted will be confined to Switzerland. It is still unclear how many Swiss-based institutions will seek membership of the exchange.     Formal applications are not due until next month but a preliminary survey completed by the Soffex project team this week showed strong interest in membership.     "The response from both Swiss and foreign institutions all over the country has been very encouraging," says Philippe Bollag of the project team.     Hans Kaufmann, who follows Swiss equities for Bank Julius Baer, says a regulated traded options exchange should boost foreign interest in Swiss shares and possibly increase bourse turnover generally.     The possibility of protecting portfolios by hedging should attract Swiss institutional investors, Kaufmann added.     Soffex is a private company set up by the five major Swiss banks and the bourses of Zurich, Geneva and Basle.     Trading will initially be limited to stock options on 10 to 15 leading Swiss bearer shares. An options contract on the new Swiss share index should follow within six months but trading in financial futures will be delayed until an unspecified future date. Options on foreign shares may also be added later.     Participants will be either brokers or dealers, operating in the market through computer terminals in their own offices. Trading must be conducted exclusively through the exchange.     Exchange membership is open to banks, traders and brokerage firms with an office in Switzerland, while Clearing Members must be recognised as banks under Swiss law.     The trading system, based on Digital Equipment Corp software and hardware, provides for the display of best bid and offer prices, matches orders electronically, allows anonymous negotiation of block orders and maintains members' order books.     An "interest" facility, aimed at helping participants to gauge the market mood, shows the number of users watching a particular instrument at any time. Most of the electronic clearing functions will be carried out overnight.     Each contract will cover only five shares instead of the 100 shares normally traded on existing options and futures markets in the United States, London, Amsterdam and Stockholm.     This reflects the fact that Swiss shares often cost thousands of francs. Bearer shares in F. Hoffman-La Roche und Co AG <HOFZ.Z>, likely to be on the Soffex opening list, were quoted this week at 209,000 francs each.     Contracts will initally be offered for the three end-months following the trading date plus the subsequent January, April, July or October end-months. Longer maturities may be added in future if market liquidity permits.     Detailed provisions have still to be worked out in areas such as margin requirements, position limits, the supervisory and regulatory functions of the exchange and brokerage fees.     Banks polled by Reuters in a random survey were enthusiastic about Soffex but reticent about the level of their own involvement and about the exchange's prospects for success.     "We're moving into completely new surroundings and it will require a change in psychology," said a securities dealer at a major Swiss bank. "We in Switzerland are not used to sitting all day at a screen where nobody shouts at you."     Moving into traded options will also require considerable investment in equipment and staff by participants. Completely new dealing and back-office skills will have to be acquired and some banks are already sending staff abroad for training.  REUTER ;

TEST;16-MAR-1987 07:19:08.54;ECUADOR SAYS IT WILL PAY DEBT WHEN IT CAN;  President Leon Febres Cordero said Ecuador would honour its debt when it had the capacity to make payments, but said foreign banks had calculated oil would have to be 25 dlrs a barrel for Ecuador to meet its commitments.     Ecuador said on Friday that last week's earthquake was forcing it to reaffirm an earlier decision -- based on the slide in world oil prices -- to suspend debt payments to private foreign banks, which hold two-thirds of its 8.16 billion dlr foreign debt.     "All legitimate debt is a commitment of honour," the president said during a visit to the quake zone. "A government as a sovereign entity has dignity and prestige to maintain."     Private foreign banks and the World Bank had calculated oil would have to be at least 25 dlrs a barrel for Quito to be able to meet its commitments, Febres Cordero said.     He added that Ecuadorean crude was now selling for 15 to 17 dlrs a barrel after having been sold for many months at 12 dlrs a barrel and as low as seven dlrs before that.     Meanwhile, Ecuador announced an austerity program and a price freeze on key consumer goods as a result of the earthquake, which killed at least 300 people.     Presidency Minister Patricio Quevedo said the budget would be cut by five to 10 pct, government hiring would be frozen and salaries of top officials, including the president and cabinet, would be reduced.     He also said a price freeze would be imposed on 20 basic consumer items, mainly food staples, while the price of gasoline would rise by between 69 and 80 pct and bus fares would rise by 20 pct. Gasoline supplies would also be limited.  Reuter ;

TEST;16-MAR-1987 08:08:22.08;U.K. AND GERMANY LEAD ATTACK ON EC FARM REFORMS;     By Paul Mylrea, Reuters Britain and West Germany told their European Community partners they would strongly oppose major elements of proposals to rid the EC of its farm surpluses.     At a meeting of EC foreign ministers, Britain called for a full debate on a proposed tax on edible oils and fats that has already angered EC consumer groups and unleashed Washington-led protests from exporters to the EC, diplomats said.     West Germany, also opposed to the oils and fats tax, will advise the meeting formally later today it cannot countenance other proposals that could hit German farmers, they added.     They said West Germany's objections were put in a letter this weekend from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to Jacques Delors, the president of the EC's Executive Commission which had put forward the proposals last month in a bid to avoid a new EC cash crisis.     Kohl reiterated German objections to proposed cereals production curbs but reserved his harshest criticism for a proposed dismantling of Monetary Compensatory Amounts (MCAs) - a system of cross-border subsidies and taxes which level out foreign exchange fluctuations for farm exports.     Kohl made clear the dismantling would mainly hit German farmers who, without MCAs, would find it much more difficult to export to weaker currency states, which means virtually all other 11 EC states, diplomats said.     Britain initiated the discussion on the proposal to impose a hefty tax on domestic and imported oils and fats because it could seriously damage EC trade relations.     The diplomats said the United States had been the most outspoken among foreign critics of the proposal, describing it as a breach of the EC's obligations under the world trade body GATT.     But protests had also come from other exporters to the EC, such as Senegal, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil, Argentina, Iceland and Norway, they added.     Britain has often lined up against West Germany on the farm reform issue in the past but is keen to avoid measures that could spark a damaging trade war with the U.S.     Foreign ministers were unlikely to take a decision on either the oils and fats tax or the MCA proposals today, diplomats said. But their discussion should make clear that neither has a chance of surviving when it comes up for substantive consideration by EC farm ministers later this month, they added.  REUTER ;

TEST;16-MAR-1987 09:15:43.81;ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT -FRANCE AWAITS ECONOMIC LIFT;     By Brian Childs, Reuters A year after squeezing to power with a narrow bare coalition majority, Gaullist Prime minister Jacques Chirac has swept away a cobweb of controls and regulations choking the French economy.     But France is still waiting for a promised industrial recovery the government says will follow from its free market policies. Company profits and the stock market are rising. But so is unemployment. Growth is stagnant at about two pct a year and the outlook for inflation, held to a 20-year low of 2.1 pct in 1986, is uncertain.     Forced last month to cut the government's 1987 growth target and raise its inflation estimate, Finance Minister Edouard Balladur ruled out action to stimulate the economy. But some government supporters say they fear time for an economic miracle may be running out.     The political clock is ticking towards Presidential elections due by April next year.     France's economic performance, led by a mixed cast of right-wing ministers and a socialist President, has won mixed reviews from non-partisan analysts.     For Michel Develle, Director of Economic Studies at newly-privatised Banque Paribas, the government's outstanding achievement has been to launch "a veritable intellectual revolution" breaking the staid habits formed by centuries of state control.     "The figures may look mediocre -- neither good nor bad -- but set in their context of structural reforms, they are excellent," Develle said.     But some analysts say they fear that Balladur, chief architect of the government's free market policies, may be pursuing a mirage.     "The belief that economic liberalism will produce an explosion of economic forces is ideological" said Indosuez chief economist Jean Cheval. "Personally I think it's an illusion. Dirigisme (direction) is a basic fact of the French system, from school onwards. Ultra-liberalism is impossible."     Illusion or not, the government has pushed its vision hard. Over the past year foreign exchange and consumer price controls have been largely abolished, labour regulations have been pruned to ease the sacking of redundant workers and a hugely popular programme has been launched to sell state-owned banks and industries to private investors.     Since December, nearly five mln French investors have bought shares in Cie Financiere de Paribas <PARI.PA> and glass maker Cie de Saint-Gobain SA <SGEP.PA>, the first two state companies brought to the stock market under the 300 billion franc five-year privatisation plan.     Encouraged by an amnesty for past illegal exports of capital, and the lifting of most currency controls, money has flooded into the Paris stockmarket from abroad, helping to lift the market 57 pct last year and another 12.5 pct since December.     At the end of last year the government abolished price controls that had existed for 42 years on services such as car repairs and hairdressing, freeing from state intervention small businesses which account for some 60 pct of the French economy.     The immediate result was a 0.9 pct rise in consumer prices in January, partly responsible for a forced revision in the official 1987 inflation forecast, to 2.5 pct from two pct or less.     "But even 2.5 pct would be a fantastic result, when you consider that prices are now free for the first time since 1945," commented Develle of Paribas.     Other achievements include a major reduction in the state's foreign debts, and a cut in the state budget deficit to 141.1 billion francs last year, 2.5 billion francs below target and down from 153.3 billion in 1985.     But despite a healthy balance of payments surplus and a gradual improvement in industrial productivity, the French franc was forced by speculators in January into a humiliating three pct devaluation against the West German mark, its second since Chirac took power.     A recent report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development pilloried French industry for failing to produce the goods that its potential customers wanted.     Outside the mainly state-controlled high technology sectors, French industrial goods were "increasingly ill-adapted to demand" and over-priced, the report said.     French economists, including Cheval at Indosuez, agreed with the report. "One of the assumptions of the government is that if you give them freedom, the employers will invest and modernise....But nine out of ten will say yes, they like freedom, and then wait to be told which way to go," he said.     And despite rising industrial investment and the introduction of special incentives to boost youth employment, the end-1986 number of jobless was reported at a record 2.7 million, some 300,000 more than a year earlier.     The problem for the government is that there may be little more it can do to prod the economy into faster growth.     French producers failed more than most to take advantage of last year's oil price falls and growth hopes now rest on the shaky prospects of expansion in other industrial countries like West Germany and Japan, they say.

The company said a hearing on the adequacy of the associated disclosure plan is scheduled for April Nine and completion of the plan is subject to approval by creditors, equity security holders and the bankruptcy court.     Salant said it has reached agreement for Ray W. williams to continue as president and chief executive officer for five years from the effective date of the reorganization plan and has substantially concluded talks for a new 15 mln dlr unsecured credit, effective the same date.     The company said the committee of its unsecured creditgors and the committee of its equity security holders have approved the terms of the plan.  As previously announced, creditors will receive 450 mln dlrs in cash, 500 dlrs of 13-1/4 pct senior subordinated debentures and four common shares for each 1,000 dlrsd of allowed unsecured claims.

TEST;16-MAR-1987 10:45:39.20;SWISS OPTIONS, FUTURES EXCHANGE PLANNED FOR 1988;     By Richard Murphy, Reuters Preparations for the launch of a Swiss options and futures exchange, billed as the first completely electronic market of its kind, are at an advanced stage, according to members of the project team.     The Swiss Options and Financial Futures Exchange (Soffex) is a new departure in that it will introduce an additional range of financial instruments and electronic trading methods to the traditionally conservative Swiss market.     There will be no physical exchange floor and both trading and clearing systems will be completely automated.     The new market, due to start operating in January 1988, follows a series of innovations by the bourses in Zurich, Basle and Geneva aimed at preventing loss of business in the face of keen competition from London and Frankfurt.     These innovations included the introduction last October of continuous trading in major shares, plans to establish a single continuously updated Swiss share index from next month to supplement the various indices produced by the major banks at the close of business, and experiments in electronic trade.     Banks themselves last year took the initiative of launching covered warrants on shares of other Swiss companies.     "If Switzerland wants to maintain and expand its international prominence in portfolio management, our bankers and fund managers must have the same modern instruments at their disposal as their competitors," says Soffex president Rudolf Mueller, a director of Union Bank of Switzerland.     The computer terminals on which business will be conducted will be confined to Switzerland. It is still unclear how many Swiss-based institutions will seek membership of the exchange.     Formal applications are not due until next month but a preliminary survey completed by the Soffex project team this week showed strong interest in membership.     "The response from both Swiss and foreign institutions all over the country has been very encouraging," says Philippe Bollag of the project team.     Hans Kaufmann, who follows Swiss equities for Bank Julius Baer, says a regulated traded options exchange should boost foreign interest in Swiss shares and possibly increase bourse turnover generally.     The possibility of protecting portfolios by hedging should attract Swiss institutional investors, Kaufmann added.     Soffex is a private company set up by the five major Swiss banks and the bourses of Zurich, Geneva and Basle.     Trading will initially be limited to stock options on 10 to 15 leading Swiss bearer shares. An options contract on the new Swiss share index should follow within six months but trading in financial futures will be delayed until an unspecified future date. Options on foreign shares may also be added later.     Participants will be either brokers or dealers, operating in the market through computer terminals in their own offices. Trading must be conducted exclusively through the exchange.     Exchange membership is open to banks, traders and brokerage firms with an office in Switzerland, while clearing members must be recognised as banks under Swiss law.     The trading system, based on Digital Equipment Corp software and hardware, provides display of best bid and offer prices, matches orders electronically, allows anonymous negotiation of block orders and maintains member order books.     An "interest" facility, aimed at helping participants to gauge the market mood, shows the number of users watching a particular instrument at any time. Most of the electronic clearing functions will be carried out overnight.     Each contract will cover only five shares instead of the 100 shares normally traded on existing options and futures markets in the United States, London, Amsterdam and Stockholm.     This reflects the fact that Swiss shares often cost thousands of francs. Bearer shares in F. Hoffmann-La Roche und Co AG, likely to be on the Soffex opening list, were quoted this week at 209,000 francs each.     Contracts will initally be offered for the three end-months following the trading date plus the subsequent January, April, July or October end-months. Longer maturities may be added in future if market liquidity permits.     Detailed provisions have still to be worked out in areas such as margin requirements, position limits, the supervisory and regulatory functions of the exchange and brokerage fees.     Banks polled by Reuters in a random survey were enthusiastic about Soffex but reticent about the level of their own involvement and about the exchange's prospects for success.     "We're moving into completely new surroundings and it will require a change in psychology," said a securities dealer at a major Swiss bank. "We in Switzerland are not used to sitting all day at a screen where nobody shouts at you."     Moving into traded options will also require considerable investment in equipment and staff by participants. Completely new dealing and back-office skills will have to be acquired and some banks are already sending staff abroad for training.  Reuter ;

TEST;16-MAR-1987 11:07:00.92;IRAN PROBERS AGREE ON IMMUNITY FOR POINDEXTER;     By Michael Posner Congressional investigators of the Iran-contra scandal have tentatively agreed to grant immunity from prosecution to a star witness --President Reagan's former national security adviser John Poindexter, congressional sources said today.     Sources told Reuters the chief counsels of the two special committees probing the two-year episode that has darkened the White House image plan to take their preliminary accord to court-appointed special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh, possibly today or tomorrow.     The tentative accord follows weeks of negotiating with Walsh and with committee members.    Poindexter would be the highest ranking official to be granted immunity in the investigations of the 1985-1986 arms sales to Iran to gain release of hostages held in Lebanon and the clandestine shifting of arms profits to arm U.S.-backed rebels in Nicaragua, at a time aid would have been illegal.     If the agreement --reached on Friday by Arthur Liman and John Nields, chief legal advisors of the Senate and House committees respectively --is ratified as expected by Walsh and the full committees, closed door interviews could be held with Poindexter in two months with public testimony in about 90 days or mid June, sources said.     "They have tentatively reached an agreement and are supposed to meet with Walsh or his deputies," a source told Reuters of the deliberations by the two chief counsels     Sources said Poindexter could assist investigators determine what Reagan knew about the diversion of funds from arms sales to Iran to rebels in Nicaragua, if anything.     Reagan has denied knowing about the shift of funds although he has admitted he gave orders to sell arms through Israel in either August or after the first shipment in September 1985, but can't remember when. Congress was kept in the dark about the affair until last autumn.     "He will be a credible witness," one source said of the pipe-smoking Poindexter.      Besides Reagan's knowledge, or lack of it, another key unanswered questions lingering from earlier congressional investigators and a special presidential review board, is who received  millions of dollars from clandestine arms profits.       So far the money trail uncovered by probers stops at secret Swiss and Cayman Islands bank accounts.     The committees have been privately negotiating with Walsh over the immunity matter, and the prosecutor, also called an independent counsel, has been urging the committees to hold off on their request for at least 90 days.     Under the tentative accord, the wishes of Walsh could be met since public testimony is not expected before 90 days.     Poindexter, a Navy vice admiral, along with his fired deputy at the National Security Council, Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North, have refused to testify before investigators, claiming their fifth amendment rights against self incrimination.     Yesterday, Vice President George Bush said in a a television interview that he disagreed with Maureen about court martials, but he too disclaimed any details of diverted funds.     So far, granting immunity to compel testimony from reluctant witnesses has been granted to five persons--with the key figure so far, shadowy California international arms merchant Albert Hakim.     Also, getting immunity has been North's attractive personal secretary, Fawn Hall, who was said to have assisted North in shredding documents in his White House basement office after the scandal broke.

TEST;16-MAR-1987 12:20:08.33;SALOMON RAISES CATERPILLAR <CAT> OPINION;  Salomon Brothers Inc said it raised its opinion on Caterpillar Inc's stock to an aggressive buy from a hold because of a brighter earnings outlook for 1988.     Salomon analyst David Sutliff said in a statement he sees 1988 earnings of 3.35 dlrs a share, up from an earlier forecast of three dlrs for the year. The outlook for 1987 remains at 2.50 dlrs to three dlrs.     Caterpillar's stock was down 1/2 points at 46-1/4.     "Although earnings will be poor for the next two quarters, we believe that profits could begin to improve in the second half - perhaps significantly - and should surge sharply through 1988 and 1989," he said.     Sutliff said improved results should come from four factors - higher prices, improved market share, reduced costs, and improved demand.     The higher prices will stick because its Japanese competitor, Komatsu, has had to raise prices because of the increased value of the yen, he said.  Reuter ;
TEST;16-MAR-1987 12:27:30.96;CONSUL RESTAURANT <CNSL> IN EXCHANGE OFFER;  Consul Restaurant Corp said it began an exchange offer for its 13 pct convertible debentures due 1992 with an aggregate principal amount of 17.5 mln dlrs.     Consul officials told an analysts meeting that in return for each 1,000 dlr face value of the bonds tendered, investors will receive 10 shares of preferred stock convertible after Dec 1, 1987, into 500 shares of common. The company said the value represents a substantial premium over the debentures' market value, which traded at 410 dlrs per 1,000 dlr face amount on March 13.     Consul said the debt was taken on to finance expansion.     James Crivits, Consul chairman, said debt service on the outstanding debentures has cost the company 55 cts a share per quarter and cut deeply into the company's profitability.     For the year ended May 31, 1986, the company reported a net loss of 1.12 dlr per share or 5.3 mln dlrs on revenues of 77.6 mln dlrs.     Crivits said the company will report an improved but still unprofitable third quarter ended February 28, compared to a loss of 22 cts a share in the year-ago thrid quarter. He said current third quarter results would be similar to 1987's second quarter's loss of 12 cts per share.     Crivits said the company will not produce a gain in the fourth quarter or the full year, and said there will be a write off in the fourth quarter for the debenture exchange offer. He would not specify the amount of the write off.     Robert Lamp, Consul's chief financial officer, said the company needs to have at least 90 pct of the bonds exchanged in the transaction to report a profit in the first quarter of fiscal 1988. Lamp said that if the exchange is successful, the company will report profits much higher than the three cents a share reported in the first quarter of fiscal 1987.     The Minneapolis-based company, which it said is the nation's largest franchisee of Chi-Chi's family-style Mexican restaurants, said it had the planned to expand to 80 units, but had to abandon the effort, leaving 38 units in operation.     The company also said the restaurants are profitable, with profit margins increasing over last year.  Reuter ;
TEST;16-MAR-1987 12:30:11.94;U.S. CAPACITY USE RATE 79.8 PCT IN FEBRUARY;  U.S. factories, mines and utilities operated at 79.8 pct of capacity in February, compared with a revised 79.6 pct in January and December, the Federal reserve Board said.     The Fed previously said the rate was 79.7 pct in January and 79.5 pct in December.     A surge in automobile assemblies in February and a gain in primary metals production helped raise manufacturing to 80.1 pct capacity from 79.9 pct in January.     Durables manufacturing increased to 76.8 pct last month from 76.3 pct in January, the Fed said.     Nondurable manufacturing eased to 85.2 pct of capacity use from 85.4 pct in January.     Last month's rate was down from 80.2 pct in February, 1986.     Fabricated metals increased to 81.4 pct in February from 81.2 pct in January, while motor vehicles and parts jumped to 83.6 pct from 80.0 in January.     Primary metals rose to 67.7 pct from 66.7 pct in January.     Petroleum products fell to 92.5 pct in February from 94.5 pct in January.     Capacity utilization for mining rose to 75.3 pct in February from 75.1 pct in January, but was below the February 1986 rate of 79.4 pct, the Fed said.     The use rate for utilities was up to 80.8 pct last month from 80.4 pct in January.     Producers of industrial materials operated at 78.9 pct of capacity, the same as in January and December, but down from the February 1986 rate of 79.6 pct.     The Fed said the decline in energy materials use and durables goods materials were the reason for the decline over the past year for producers of industrial materials.  Reuter ;

The plane, which is similar in concept to the Orient Express project announced by President Reagan last year, would have four ram-jet motors, lacking the moving parts of conventional turbo-jet engines, and each having 30 tonnes of thrust.     It would cruise at an altitude of up to 30,000 metres, around three times higher than conventional aircraft and nearly twice as high as the Anglo-French Concorde supersonic jet.     With a range of 12,000 km it would be capable of flying from Paris to New York in one hour, compared with three hours taken by Concorde, and Paris to Tokyo in two hours.     The aircraft could reach speeds in excess of 5,000 km an hour.

TEST;16-MAR-1987 13:53:14.03;ETHIOPIA MINISTER SEES AFRICA DEBT PAYMENT PROBLEM;  Africa may have to follow Brazil in halting foreign debt payments unless industrialised nations are prepared to be more flexible in trade and economic policy, Ethiopian trade minister Tesfay Dinka said.     Growing protectionism and declining commodity prices had caused a major deterioration in the export earnings of all developing countries, he said in an opening speech to a meeting of African trade ministers in Addis Ababa.     Unless there was an early improvement in developing countries' terms of trade "the only choice is to follow the route that Brazil appears to have taken," Tesfay said.    The two-day meeting of delegates from 50 African states was called to work out a consensus ahead of the Group of 77 ministerial meeting in Havana next month, when the developing countries will debate their strategy in economic negotiations with the West.     Tesfay accused the West of intransigence in the negotiation of recent commodity agreements.     The failure of the International Coffee Organisation to agree on the reintroduction of export quotas would mean "several African countries will not have the foreign exchange to import essential items," he said.     Coffee accounts for 60 pct of Ethiopian exports and the recent fall in world coffee prices has sharply reduced the country's foreign exchange earnings.     Adebayo Adedeji, the executive secretary of the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa, told the meeting that there was an increasing net outflow of resources from Africa.     He blamed this on high interest rates, debt servicing and the repatriation of profits by foreign investors.     Africa paid 13 billion dlrs to service its total foreign debt last year and by 1990 annual service payments are expected to rise to between 16 and 24 billion, Adedeji said.     He accused industrialised countries of failing to provide more resources to implement the U.N. Program for Africa's economic recovery and development, despite Africa's willingness to raise two thirds of the capital from domestic sources.     The U.N. Program, approved last year, calls for 128 billion dlrs of economic investment in Africa over five years.     Western donors were asked to contribute 46 billion dlrs, with the rest being raised from local resources, but Adedeji said the donors had not responded as hoped.    In view of this poor response, he said "it is possible that by the year 2,000 nearly all African countries, except a few, will be categorised as least developed countries."     At present, 27 of Africa's 50-odd states are officially listed in this category.  REUTER ;

Such triple expirations occur four times a year and in the past have been associated with big swings in stock market averages. In a new variation of the disclosure rules, the NYSE said no market-on-close orders related to index arbitrage can be entered after 1530 EST.     The NYSE said all market-on-close orders for 50 big capitalization stocks, including the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, must be entered by 1530 EST Friday. The NYSE will then furnish to financial news services any imbalance in market-on-close orders of 10,000 shares or more.     After 1530 EST market-on-close orders in the 50 stocks can be entered only on the opposite side of the imbalance. But the bar on entering market-on-close orders related to index arbitrage after 1530 EST is a new element of the disclosure plan, which has the goal of making the market less volatile during the triple expirations.

In a briefing book for the drafting sessions, a number of revenue raising tax options are proposed, including a five dlrs a barrel fee on domestic and imported oil, a fee just on imported oil, and a broad based tax on domestic energy consumption based on five pct of value.     Other proposals include various excise taxes and combinations of import surcharges or tariffs, including a 10 pct import across the board import surcharge that would raise 22 billion dlrs next year alone, more in later years.     The committee, however, will only include revenue numbers in its proposed budget with the actual revenue decisions left to the House and Senate tax-writing committees.      The committee will draft a budget which its chairman, Sen Lawton Chiles, a Florida Democrat, said he hopes would raise at least 18 billion dlrs in revenues, or about half the minimum 36 billion dlr deficit reduction he has in mind.

The suit charges the offering materials are materially false and misleading and misstate and conceal material information required to be disclosed to shareholders.     The suit also charges the offer is illusory and designed to manipulate the market in Caesars World stock to enable Sosnoff to sell the Caesars World stock he already owns for a substantial profit.

Caesars World is expected to seek a friendly suitor, restructure operations, or buy back Sosnoff's holdings in an attempt to fight off the bid.

TEST;16-MAR-1987 19:06:29.51;EC COMMISSION DEFENDS FARM PROGRAM;  The European Community's (EC) executive Commission defended attacks on major elements of its ambitious program to rid the EC of its controversial farm surpluses, after strong attacks from northern states.     Britain and West Germany, backed by the Netherlands and Denmark, opposed a proposed tax on edible oils and fats which has already sparked strong protest from exporters to the EC led by the U.S. and from EC consumer groups, diplomats said.     But EC Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen told journalists he had warned ministers that failure to agree the tax, proposed last month as part of the Commission's annual farm price package, would leave a large hole in the group's budget.     He added that he hoped states had not yet made their mind up for good. "I hope the debate is still open, if not there will be a formidable hole in the budget," he said.     The shortfall could reach two billion dollars in 1988 and would be only slightly less this year, he said.     Foreign ministers were taking a first look at the tax ahead of farm ministers in a move described by diplomats as unprecedented and welcomed by Andriessen as a sign ministers recognised the importance of reforming the EC's farm policy.     The proposed tax is designed to provide the EC with extra cash to finance community oilseed crops at their current levels and to brake a dramatic decrease in olive oil consumption by making it more competitive with other oils.     Andriessen noted the EC has over two mln olive oil producers, mostly small farmers, who could be helped by the tax.     "What we are suggesting is reasonable, it should be better understood not just outside the community but at home," he said.     Britain, normally a keen advocate of radical changes in the EC's costly farm subsidies system, warned the proposal to impose the tax on both domestic and imported oils and fats could seriously damage the EC's trade relations with other countries.     Britain also warned that the tax could hit developing countries already receiving aid from the EC, they said.     The Commission also defended proposals to dismantle Monetary Compensatory Amounts (MCA) -- a system of cross border subsidies and taxes to level out foreign exchange fluctuations for farm exports -- against harsh West German criticism.     In a letter this weekend from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to EC executive Commission President, Jacques Delors, Kohl made clear such a dismantling would mainly hit West German farmers.     Diplomats said West Germany again repeated its criticism at the talks here but Andriessen told journalists that Germany had been alone in its opposition. The question was a key aspect of the Commission's farm price proposals, he added.    Ministers also agreed a 3.5 billion dlrs scheme to rid the EC of its butter mountain, despite Spanish and Portuguese opposition.     The scheme will pay for the disposal of one mln tonnes of unwanted butter, by selling it at knock-down prices, turning it into animal feed or exporting it at subsidised prices.     National capitals are due to be reimbursed later out of savings from another plan to curb milk production.     Diplomats said Spain and Portugal have been angered by the scheme, which they feel forces them to pay for massive surpluses built up before they joined the community last year, but the two countries did not block today's vote.

TEST;16-MAR-1987 22:16:59.36;EC AGREES ON AID PACKAGE FOR MEDITERRANEAN STATES;  European Community (EC) foreign ministers have agreed on an aid package of loans and grants totalling more than 1.6 billion European Currency Units (Ecu) for states in the southern and eastern Mediterranean region.    The five-year accord increases aid to the states, Tunisia, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Algeria, Egypt and Syria, by about 60 pct from the previous pact, Belgian Foreign Minister Leo Tindemans told a news conference. The EC's executive Commission had proposed a package of more than 1.7 billion Ecus, about 70 pct more than the last aid deal, but West Germany and Britain called for the rise to be kept to 30 pct.     The package includes 615 mln Ecus in cash grants from the EC, while just over one billion Ecus will be made available in loans from the European Investment Bank, the EC's long-term investment arm. Details of how the money is to be distributed will be worked out by EC officials.     Syria, while still officially included on the list, will not receive any money unless EC ministers specifically agree to it. The EC last year imposed sanctions against Syria because of its alleged role in the attempted bombing of an Israeli airliner.  REUTER ;
TEST;16-MAR-1987 22:24:31.28;STRIKES AGAINST WAGE FREEZE SPREAD IN YUGOSLAVIA;  Strikes against a government freeze on wages spread to most regions of Yugoslavia last week, the official news agency Tanjug said last night.     It said thousands of workers were involved, and officials feared more strikes were on the way.     At least 60 strikes have taken place around Yugoslavia in the past two weeks, but most of those previously reported were in the northern republic of Croatia.     Prime Minister Branko Mikulic imposed the wage freeze last month in an effort to curb rampant inflation, now running at an annual rate of almost 100 pct.     The government froze wages at their level in the fourth quarter of 1986 and said any future rises must be linked to productivity.     The measure met widespread disapproval. Even some senior executives of major industrial enterprises have criticised the freeze in interviews with Tanjug.     The agency said strikes took place last week in the southern republic of Montenegro and the predominantly ethnic Albanian province of Kosovo. In the central republic of Bosnia and Hercegovina 1,700 workers struck, while many teachers in Belgrade refused to take their paychecks.     Earlier, Yugoslav journalists, who asked to remain anonymous, told Reuters they had been barred from strike-hit factories.     They said they had been told they could not enter without permits, whereas before the strikes no permits had been necessary to visit factories.  REUTER ;

A parent company spokesman said the Ohio plant, which makes 360,000 cars a year, is now also producing 1,100 cc and 1,200 cc motorcycles, partly for export.     Motorcycle output in Ohio totalled 28,000 in 1986, down 33 pct from a year earlier, but the shift in production will raise production to 44,000 in 1987, the spokesman said.     The move to the U.S. Of large motorcycle manufacturing was also due partly to higher U.S. Tariffs for imported motorcyles bigger than 700 cc, industry sources said.     The U.S. Imposed tariffs on imports of large motorcycles from April 1983, starting at 49.9 pct and gradually falling, to help the U.S. Motorcycle manufacturing industry to reconstruct, the sources said. The tariff for U.S. Fiscal year 1987/88 is set at 14.5 pct.     They said the U.S. Planned to cut the tariff to 4.4 pct for fiscal 1988/89, but that the higher level is likely to be kept for a few years due to the slow pace of reconstruction.  REUTER ;

The December figure was revised from a provisional 4.8 billion franc surplus reported a month ago.     On an unadjusted basis, January payments showed a 5.2 billion franc deficit after a revised 7.1 billion December surplus. The December unadjusted surplus was revised down from a provisional 8.2 billion.     The Ministry said trade, measured on balance of payments criteria, showed an unadjusted 7.1 billion franc January deficit while services showed a 3.7 billion surplus.     Other items, mainly including unilateral transfers, showed a 1.8 billion deficit.     The current account showed an adjusted surplus of 6.1 billion francs in January last year, and an unadjusted deficit of one billion.     The full year 1986 current account surplus was reported last month at 25.8 billion francs.  REUTER ;
TEST;17-MAR-1987 06:59:48.28;ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - SAUDI CORPORATE DEBT;     By Stephen Jukes, Reuters Bankers in Saudi Arabia are negotiating a delicate balance between western business practice and oriental justice as they try to restructure the troubled corporate sector's debt.     The problem lies in reconciling Saudi Arabia's western-style banking system and an Islamic, "Sharia" legal system in which interest payments may be viewed as usury and illegal.     So Saudi Arabia's 11 commercial banks have pinned hopes on negotiated settlements rather than enforced ones, and are resigned to not being able to recoup loans in full.     And they have become highly selective over enterprises eligible for new credit after a run of failures that forced heavy loan loss provisions and ate relentlessly into profits.     As a result, they have attracted complaints from a business community that says it is starved of funds while the government is criticising it for not playing a larger role in the economy.     The private sector's downturn began in earnest in 1983 as oil prices slid and some companies were slow to react, businessmen said. Bloated inventories and in some cases poor management created problems. Some also blamed the government for not paying for public sector contracts promptly.     Long negotiations to reschedule some debt are now producing results. One banker said, "Banks are agreeing reschedulings, but often at a high price... They are resigned to the fact that full recovery (of loans) is not always possible."     In a few cases private sector firms have been stripped of assets during or prior to debt renegotiations, leaving banks virtually no hope of repayment in full.     The first major rescheduling was not sealed until mid-February this year when <Arabian Auto Agency>, known as AAA, reached agreement to stretch out repayments of 700 mln riyals of debt to some 50 Saudi and international banks.     Bankers said the deal for the Jeddah-based heavy equipment importer is likely to set a precedent for the private sector. It was greeted with relief after 18 months of negotiations.     AAA's rescheduling has been followed in the last few days by a draft accord on the 1.3 billion riyal debt of one of the Kingdom's most publicised companies, <Saudi Research and Development Corp>, REDEC. These two cases have raised hopes that other companies will also reach agreement soon.     Bankers said the cement importer <Arabian Bulk Trade>, and the construction and trading firm <Ali and Fahd Shobokshi Group> are still negotiating with creditor banks.     They are increasingly resigned to there being little legal recourse in Saudi Arabia, and that rescheduling with payments geared to a company's cash-flow -- often very low -- is the only way to recover at least a portion of outstanding loans.     Though bankers feel they generally have the tacit backing of the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA), the Kingdom's central bank, some say it should take a more active role.     However, bankers said it is encouraging SAMA has not blocked a "black list" of borrowers banks have drawn up and circulated for over a year.     Bankers said the AAA accord, negotiated by a committee led by <Saudi British Bank>, is a likely model in that banks have not insisted on full repayment of all obligations.     Sixty pct of the debt will be repaid in monthly instalments over seven years at 1/4 point over Bahrain interbank offered rates (BIBOR). The remaining 40 pct is only to be paid after completion of the first tranche, also at 1/4 over BIBOR. And accrued interest on the 40 pct will be waived as long as the first tranche is met in full.     As one banker put it, "Many banks took the view it was better to get some money back rather than none at all."  REUTER ;

TEST;17-MAR-1987 08:47:38.36;TALKING POINT/COPPER STOCKS;     By Steven Radwell, Reuters Copper shares, which have lagged behind the market, should pick up steam this year on stronger demand and improving prices for the metal, analysts said.     "Copper prices should move up over the next four to six quarters," said Daniel Roling of Merrill Lynch and Co <MER>. "I see average copper prices at 70 cts a pound in 1988, up from around 63 or 64 cts, based on tight supply and continued world economic growth."     Other analysts see metal prices ranging from 65 to 68 cts a pound this year and 70 to 73 cts in 1988.     Analysts said Phelps Dodge Corp <PD> will be a strong performer because it is the largest U.S. copper producer.     But Asarco Inc <AR>, with about 45 pct of total sales from copper, and Newmont Mining Corp <NEM> are also potential winners, they said. Newmont is spinning off 85 pct of its copper operations to its shareholders.     "In theory, Phelps is the best stock. It's the purest play and benefits most from higher copper prices," one said.     William Siedenburg of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co, said Phelps has lowered costs and streamlined mining operations. "They've accomplished a great deal," he said.     The company's move into carbon black, a product used in tires, should provide steady earnings, although not rapid growth, as a hedge against a copper downturn, Siedenburg said. He estimates Phelps will earn 2.45 dlrs in 1987 and 4.45 dlrs in 1988, including tax benefits, versus 1.79 dlrs in 1986.     Other analysts, including Clarence Morrison of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc and Merrill's Roling, also recommend Phelps.     Morrison projects Phelps will earn 3.25 dlrs in 1987 and four dlrs in 1988, while Roling sees earnings at 2.75 dlrs this year and around 3.50 dlrs next year.     "The stock can go to the mid 30s," Roling said, from its current level of around 30. But others see it climbing to 40.     "Their (Phelps Dodge) costs are so low, they don't need copper prices higher than 70 cts to make a lot of money," said Vahid Fathi of Prescott Ball and Turben Inc. "The shares will outperform the market over the next 18 months," he said.     But Nick Toufexis of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc says Newmont Mining is a more attractive investment. "We'd rather place our bets with Newmont. Any way you slice it, I see a significant premium to the current stock price," he said.     After the spinoff, which closes next month, Newmont will have gold operations, including 95 pct of Newmont Gold Co <NGC>, a 15 pct stake in its copper unit and energy operations, Toufexis noted.     Analysts see Newmont earning 2.85 dlrs to three dlrs in 1987 and about 3.75 dlrs in 1988, versus earnings of about 1.40 dlrs from operations in 1986.     "I'd be buying up to 90," Toufexis said last week, when the stock rose sharply to near that level. "But the shares are probably worth about 108 dlrs (each)."     Dean Witter's Morrison and Fathi of Prescott Ball like Asarco, because of cost cutting and restructuring. Morrison sees 1987 earnings at 1.25 dlrs and 1988 at 1.75 against losses in 1986. Fathi projects Asarco will earn one dlr in 1987 and from three dlrs to 3.25 dlrs in 1988.     Roling of Merrill Lynch is recommending Cyprus Minerals Co <CYPM> in addition to Phelps Dodge. Cyprus has interests in coal and other minerals aside from copper.     But Siedenburg of Smith Barney thinks Cyprus is overpriced at current levels. "I would be willing to sell Cyprus and buy Phelps Dodge if I were picking one copper stock," he said.  Reuter ;

TEST;17-MAR-1987 08:57:16.34;ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - U.S. BANKING REGULATION;     By Kenneth Barry, Reuters U.S. banks are under pressure to meet vigorous competition, but Congress continues to duck hard choices on banking law reform that could benefit consumers.     Supporters say deregulating banking will increase competition, offer consumers more choices and bring lower fees for financial services and home mortgage interest rates.     But the Senate Banking Committee last week put off until later in the year decisions on pressing issues such as whether banks could enter new businesses like underwriting corporate debt and selling insurance and real estate.     The committee also reined in banks' competitors, the so-called nonbank banks, which elude the technical definition of a bank because they do not both accept deposits and make loans. The committee meeting room became a battleground for giants of the financial industry -- banks, brokerages, insurance firms, retail and industrial corporations -- with but little consideration given to the consumer.     The lobbies backed various amendments to protect their turf and a bill that rescues a federal deposit insurance fund for thrift institutions and puts a moratorium on any changes in banking law was passed and sent on to the full Senate.     The House of Representatives has yet to act.     Behind the political deals was the larger question whether Congress would end or modify the half-century-old separation of commercial and investment banking or leave it alone.     One argument in support of change is that fees for financial services would come down if Congress expands banks' powers.     Lower fees to underwrite mortgage-backed securities, for example, could lead to lower interest rates on home mortgages, supporters say.     "A lot of nonbanking firms have used loopholes to get into banking, but banks have not be allowed into any new businesses," says Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution.     "We have been seeing a gigantic turf war," says Litan, who favors new powers for banks if deposits are safeguarded.     The swirl of corporate mergers and the financial information explosion have blurred the distinction between the activities of banks and security brokerages.     On a wider horizon, U.S. financial institutions face stepped-up competition from financial centers like London and Tokyo in international transactions.     West German and Japanese banking is more concentrated in a few, large banks, while most European countries allow banking and securities to be mixed.     All these forces put pressure on U.S. financial firms to adapt to change, but the congressional debate over reform drags on. The committee's bill put a freeze on any changes and its chairman, Senator William Proxmire, promised to return the issues in October. If approved by Congress, the bill would postpone applications before the Federal Reserve for new powers to three of the largest banks -- Citicorp, J.P. Morgan and Bankers Trust.     Other industries where regulatory barriers have fallen have experienced lower fees, the emergence of new players and accelerated innovation.     But these advances in airlines, trucking, and telecommunications have not been without drawbacks. Companies that were slow to adapt disappeared under the new competitive regime, while the public faced a bewildering number of new choices. The Reagan administration favors bank reform.     The traditional method companies use to raise funds -- borrowing from banks -- has given way to selling corporate debt and other new securities that are off limits to banks.     But critics say the soundness of the banking system created by such laws as the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act would be undermined.     Banks are treated as special and shielded from the marketplace's vagaries by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp (FSLIC) performs the same function for thrifts.     The one issue the committee did act on which benefits consumers is new funding for the federal insurance fund for deposits at savings and loan associations, which has fallen to its lowest ratio of reserves to deposits in history.     Despite efforts toward change in Congress, a ban on interstate banking remains.     The barriers are crumbling anyway because state legislatures are agreeing to permit bank mergers across state lines within a region.     Congress is proceeding cautiously, having in mind the banking industry's tribulations in the early 1930's.     But some say it is moving too cautiously for banks to keep pace with what is happening in business here and around the world.  Reuter ;

TEST;17-MAR-1987 10:04:16.53;EAST GERMANY ANNOUNCES ECONOMIC REFORM PLANS;  East Germany plans to devolve more responsibility to factories and boost profitability under a law obliging plants to generate their own funds for investments in new machinery, repairs or expansion, the Berliner Zeitung newspaper said.     The state would no longer finance projects under five mln marks under the law which took effect on January 1.     The paper also hinted at further, more ambitious changes if this experiment proved successful.     Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has cited East Germany's cautious industrial decentralisation as an alternative to the Hungarian model based on Western-style market economics.     The law stresses that East Germany remains committed to the centralised state-planned economic system with no market experiments.     "This new regulation is part of our general investment policy," Berliner Zeitung said, citing the growing importance of robots and high technology rather than the large-scale plant construction of the 1950s and 1960s.     "This step could be the start of even greater changes in GDR investment policy. We must wait and see," it added.     Factory investment funds would be drawn from profits above certain minimum returns pledged to the state under annual plans and from amortisation -- funds the factory is allowed to keep to compensate for depreciation in the cost of machinery.     Amortisation costs and all profits currently go back to the state, which provides all investment capital in return.     This centralisation has hindered management's response to changes in world markets vital for the East German economy, economists said.  REUTER ;
TEST;17-MAR-1987 10:04:51.74;BAKER URGES SUPPORT FOR DEVELOPMENT BANKS;  Treasury Secretary James Baker urged Congress to support the administration's financing requests for the multilateral development banks in the next two fiscal years.     Baker told a House appropriations subcommittee the administration's request for a total 2.1 billion dlrs in fiscal 1987 and 1988 would meet administration shortfalls and fulfill Washington's annual payment responsibilities.     In testimony that went over much of the same ground as his remarks to a Senate committee some two weeks ago, Baker said support for the MDBs was crucial to U.S. economic leadership.     Baker told the committee, "Our national self respect and our international leadership depend on our willingness to fulfill this responsibility."     The administration budget requests include a supplemental request for fiscal 1987 of 293 mln dlrs and a 1.8 billion dlr request for fiscal 1988.     Baker noted these requests included funding requirements negotiated by the administration with this committee.     Baker's remarks outlined why the development banks were formed and the stake the U.S. had in maintaining them.     Baker pointed out the U.S. has successfully sought reforms in several of the institutions and was pressing for reforms in others aimed at making them more efficient, with policies oriented toward free markets.     He also gave the House subcommittee a progress report on the debt strategy and emphasized the importance of continued financing for the MDBs if the U.S. is to continue to lead in resolving the debt crisis.

The Times of Zambia quoted unnamed sources as saying Zambia exported 100,000 tonnes of copper through Dar es Salaam and 17,000 through Beira in the last quarter of 1986. Diplomatic sources in Lusaka had earlier expressed doubts over Zambia's ability to ship all its copper through Beira and Dar es Salaam without causing massive bottlenecks at the ports.     Chitambala also said that the state-run Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) had closed its liaison office in Johannesburg, since it was now redundant.  Reuter ;
TEST;17-MAR-1987 11:32:05.95;K MART <KM> ENDS TALKS TO SELL STORES;  K Mart Corp said recent talks to sell 65 remaining Kresge variety stores and their underlying real estate to F.W. Woolworth Co <Z> have ended.     Robert Stevenson, K Mart vice president, told Reuters the talks, which began about six weeks ago, ended. He declined to give a reason.     Kresge is the forerunner of what is now the K Mart chain. The name was changed to K Mart in 1977, Stevenson said.     "We're selling and buying real estate in our real estate division, and Woolworth was interested in some of our properties. The talks were of a casual nature," he said.     The 65 Kresge stores that are scattered around the country in downtown and suburban locations, he said.     Stevenson said K Mart will continue to operate the stores. "The stores are profitable. The only decision K Mart has made is that we will continue to operate them," he said     Kresge had been a nationwide chain of 900 variety stores.  Reuter ;
TEST;17-MAR-1987 11:36:40.54;U.K. GROWTH RATE SEEN AT THREE PCT THIS YEAR;  Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, presenting his budget for fiscal 1987/88 to parliament, said U.K. Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar 1987.     He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of payments deficit in 1987 of 2.5 billion stg, after a 1.1 billion shortfall in 1986. Inflation is expected to be 4.0 pct at the end of 1987, he said, adding it may exceed 4.5 pct by the summer before falling back to 4.0 pct by the end of the year.     The planned PSBR for 1987/88 was 4.0 billion stg unchanged when compared with the likely outturn for fiscal 1986/87, Lawson said.     Although no explicit target was set for the broad sterling M3 money supply, Lawson said broad money will continue to be taken into account in assessing monetary conditions as well as the exchange rate.     The low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87 was mainly due to the buoyancy of non-oil tax revenues in general, and the corporation tax paid by an increasingly profitable business sector in particular.     On oil prices, Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier assumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per barrel in calendar 1987. The treasury would strive to keep the PSBR at 1.0 pct of GDP in future, he said.  Reuter ;

TEST;17-MAR-1987 11:47:50.38;CONSERVATIVE GAINS MAY SPEED FINNISH MARKET REFORM;     By Simon Haydon, Reuters Conservative gains in Finnish general elections could speed liberalisation of financial markets, though there will not be a radical economic restructuring, conservative officials and economic analysts said.     The conservatives gained nine new seats in parliament after the two-day elections, which ended yesterday, and political commentators say social democrat Prime Minister Kalevi Sorsa is likely to be replaced by a centre-right coalition.     International spokesman Pasi Natri told Reuters: "we are willing to liberalise the economy as much as possible."     Helsinki analysts said the outgoing centre-left coalition had introduced major reforms of money and stock markets in its period of government between 1983 and 1987.     They said Finnish conservatives bore little resemblance to other European conservative movements and had, for example, shelved privatisation policies to increase their popularity.     Finnish trade affairs are dominated by its special ties with its neighbour, The Soviet Union, and a new centre-right coalition could alter this relationship, the analysts said.    The two countries have a long-term pact under which trade must be balanced in value. The 1987 accord signed in January agreed bilateral trade totalling about 30 billion markka.     Finland exports finished products to the USSR, with crude oil accounting for 80 pct of imports.     The Centre Party said before the elections that Fenno- Soviet trade would have to be cut because Finland had to trim exports when the value of Moscow's oil exports to Finland fell.     Finnish financial markets reacted cautiously to the election news, with little movement in the markka or on the Helsinki stock exchange.     Securities analysts said the market would respond positively if a centre-right coalition was formed, but added it was too early to exclude the possibility that social democrats would hang on to power.     The spokesman said conservatives favoured legislation governing the stock market to prevent "casino-style behaviour."     He said the conservatives also favoured the establishment of an internal market between the Nordic countries.      International capital markets were becoming more and more important, he  said, adding conservatives would speed up the development of Finland's capial markets.    He said the conservatives supported the bilateral trade ties with Moscow, but that links with western Europe should be studied. Finland is a member of the European Free Trade Association ( EFTA).     Negotiations between the major Finnish political parties are likely to be protracted, and the shape of the new government will probably not be established before the start of April.     Conservatives hold 44 seats now, The Centre Party gained three to 40 and the social democrats lost one, and now hold 56 seats.  REUTER ;

BankAmerica said its outstanding loans to Brazil currently total about 2.7 billion dlrs, including about 1.5 billion dlrs in long-term loans and 1.2 billion dlrs in short-term loans.     The Brazilian government announced in February its intention to stop paying interest temporarily on its long-term public and private sector commercial bank debt.     "Continued deferral of interest payment on these obligations could result in the loans being placed on nonaccrual status," the banking firm said.     BankAmerica said its outstanding loans to Mexico currently total about 2.5 billion dlrs, of which about 215 mln dlrs of loans have been reported as either nonaccrual or past due 90 days or more.

Fluegel, heading one of three U.S. Soybean producer delegations currently on a lobbying tour of EC countries, told Reuters in an interview meetings with officials from the Italian Foreign and Agricultural ministries had not yielded much to encourage hopes that Italy would vote against the proposed tax.     Fluegel said his delegation had received a negative response from the Italian Agriculture Ministry, but that the attitude of the Foreign Ministry appeared "more realistic."     He said the proposed tax was discriminatory against U.S. Farmers since it was basically asking them to help finance the EC's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) on oilseeds.     Asked which EC countries might be expected to vote against the proposed tax, he said, "Realistically, from the information we're getting, it looks like the English, the Germans, hopefully the Netherlands and Denmark." His delegation also hoped to convince Belgium to vote against the issue, he added.     Asked what form he thought U.S. Retaliatory action might take in the event of the EC tax proposal being approved, Fluegel said industrial as well as agricultural products could be involved.     U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng warned the EC yesterday it would face serious retaliation if it enacted the tax.     ASA president-elect Wayne Bennett said yesterday in The Hague American soybean producers were confident the proposed tax would be rejected.  Reuter ;
TEST;17-MAR-1987 11:59:00.09;ISRAEL'S FIVE-YEAR PLAN TO BOOST AGRICULTURE;  Israel has drawn up a five-year plan for 1987-1991 to raise agricultural production by 500 mln dlrs to 2.7 billion dlrs, an annual rise of 3.4 pct, the Israeli Ministry of Agriculture said. Agricultural exports are to be increased by 180 mln dlrs, or 4.8 pct per year on average.     The area planted to cotton is to remain at the 1986 level of 100,000 to 112,500 acres with exports expected to bring in 80 to 90 mln dlrs per year. The 34 pct decline from the 1985 level reflects continued water rationing which will remain in force, the ministry said.     Groundnut production is planned to increase by 13,000 tonnes, or 57 pct, by 1991 and exports by 9,000 tonnes, or 82 pct. Maize production is targetted to rise by 48,000 tonnes, or 48 pct, and exports by 34,000 tonnes, or 45 pct.  Reuter ;

TEST;17-MAR-1987 12:26:30.76;ZAMBIAN EXCHANGE AUCTION TO RESUME AT END OF MARCH;  Zambia will reintroduce a modified foreign exchange auction at the end of this month as part of a new two-tier exchange rate, central bank governor Leonard Chivuno said.     Chivuno told a press conference at the end of three weeks of negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that there would be a fixed exchange rate for official transactions and a fluctuating rate, decided by the auction, for other types of business.     The Bank of Zambia previously held weekly auctions to distribute foreign exchange to the private sector and determine the kwacha's exchange rate, but these were suspended at the end of January.     President Kenneth Kaunda said at the time that he was suspending the auction system in view of the rapid devaluation and violent fluctations of the exchange rate which had resulted.     Business and banking sources said another reason for suspending the auction was that the central bank was low on foreign exchange and was 10 weeks behind in paying successful bidders.    The kwacha stood at 2.2 per dollar when the auction system was first introduced in October 1985, but it slid to around 15 per dollar by the time it was suspended 16 months later.     Since then, Zambia has operated a fixed exchange rate of about nine kwacha per dollar.  REUTER ;

TEST;17-MAR-1987 13:07:30.87;PLAYBOY <PLA> HAS NO RESTRUCTURING PLANS;  Playboy Enterprises Inc said it has no plans to restructure or to take the company private.     Moreover, Chairman Hugh Hefner, who owns 71 pct of the more than 9.4 mln shares outstanding, has no interest in selling his stock, spokeswoman Robyn Radomski said.      Articles in two weekly business publications have said Playboy is a takeover candidate because of what financial analysts see as its undervalued asset base.     Radomski said there were no corporate developments to account for the recent unusual trading in Playboy's shares but that there seemed to be a correlation with the two articles.     Playboy shares are currently trading at 13-5/8 on turnover of about 40,100 shares. For the past 52-weeks, the stock has traded in a range of 5-7/8 to 13-1/4 on light volume.     The reports, based on an asset evaluation by analyst Mark Boyar, place Playboy's worth at about 280 mln dlrs, or 30 dlrs a share. Boyar estimated Playboy's publishing to be worth about 130 mln dlrs, its product licensing, 50 mln dlrs, its real estate, including a mansion in Beverly Hills at 30 mln dlrs and its excess working capital after debt repayment of 70 mln dlrs, according to Business Week.     According to Boyar, the licensing division, Playboy mansion and artwork alone make the firm worth about 20 dlrs a share, the Forbes Magazine article said.     According to Advertising Age, the Playboy logo is the most recognized symbol after Coca Cola, another analyst noted.     Radomski, noting that the articles were written without contact with Playboy, said that "from time to time people do speculate about the company."     She said she had spoken with majority shareholder Hefner in the "last day or so" for a reaction to the articles.     American Securities analyst David Leibowitz believes "anyone who bought in thinking takeover or lbo (leveraged buyout) is likely to be disappointed because the chances are nil." Management has repeatedly stated it will not take the company private, he said.     But "shareholders who held the stock prior to all the publicity have gotten a heck of a ride for their money," he said.     Leibowitz said he also believes that the true asset value of the company is likely to exceed the current price of the stock. "But a leveraged buyout is not in the cards. I take management at their word," he said.     While Playboy's cable television operation is considered a drain on the company by some analysts, Liebowitz sees potential. "They do have a management plan for the cable operation and the company as a whole," he said. "Were this plan to, in fact, translate into reality, the opportunity for earnings is significant," he said.  Reuter ;

TEST;17-MAR-1987 13:16:13.88;U.S. WARNS OF DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL;  A White House-ordered report said  that growing U.S. reliance on foreign oil into the year 2000 could have potentially damaging implications for national security.     The Energy Department study discusses several options to curb reliance on foreign oil, but makes no recommendations.     President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruled out a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to help the depressed domestic oil industry.     Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that "although we have made gains in energy security in the last six years, this report shows that there is justification for national concern both over declining competitiveness of our domestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports."     The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U.S. consumption and by the mid-1990s could rise to 50 pct.     Among the report's options to ease U.S. reliance on foreign oil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration.     President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing a determination that the country never again become captive to a foreign oil cartel, referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages and sharp prices increases of the 1970s.     The report said an import fee would raise prices and help make it economical for U.S. oil firms to find and produce new oil, as well as to cut imports, but on the whole the tax would depress the nation's economy.  reuter ;

The company has agreed to permit the group and its potential lenders to perform a due diligence review of Service America, it said.     Allegheny noted it had previously cancelled plans to spin off the foodservice subsidiary.     The company said the group's review is preliminary and there is no assurance that an acquisition proposal will be made or, if made, accepted.

Following meetings with House Agriculture Committee Chairman Kika de la Garza (D-Tex.) and Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the groups issued a statement saying lawmakers should "resist efforts to overhaul the 15-month-old law, which is operating in its first crop marketing year."     The farm groups included the American Farm Bureau Federation, American Soybean Association, National Cattlemen's Association, National Corn Growers Association, National Cotton Council, National Pork Producers Council and the U.S. Rice Producers Legislative Group.     The statement said Congress should not modify the 1985 farm bill "so the law might have its intended impact of making agriculture more competitive in export markets while at the same time maintaining farm income."     "We strongly believe American farmers now need predictability and certainty in farm legislation in order to have any opportunity of making proper production and marketing decisions," the groups said.

Speaking at a House foreign agriculture subcommittee, Roberts said the U.S. has offered eep to China and Poland, and should also include the Soviet Union.     Rep.

Money market dealers speculated that the central bank could be taking the opportunity to signal a reduction in U.K. Base lending rates by cutting the rates at which it intervenes in the discount market.     Most operators are expecting a base rate cut today, possibly of one point, following yesterday's budget in which the U.K. Public sector borrowing target for 1987/88 was slashed by three billion stg.     Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain some 1.11 billion stg while a rise in note circulation and bankers' balances below target will take out around 120 mln stg and 20 mln stg respectively.     Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions will add some 140 mln stg to the system today.  REUTER ;

TEST;18-MAR-1987 10:04:30.16;VW'S AUDI SAYS PROFIT FELL AROUND 50 PCT IN 1986;  Audi AG <NSUG.F>, the 99 pct owned subsidiary of Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F>, said profit in 1986 fell by around half compared with 1985, when it achieved a record 221 mln marks net profit, a rise of 19.5 pct on the previous year.     Managing board chairman Wolfgang Habbel told a news conference he expected both profit and turnover to rise this year compared with 1986, but he said it was questionable whether 1987 profit would return to 1985 levels.     He gave no figure for 1986 profit. Audi had predicted last year that 1986 profit would likely fall by an unspecified amount from 1985's record levels.     Habbel said turnover in 1986 rose to 9.9 billion marks from 9.6 billion in 1985 and looked certain to rise to over 10 billion this year.     Asked whether Audi would pay a dividend to VW to help the parent company overcome its currency losses, Habbel said Audi would ensure VW got a share of profits.     Audi's entire 1985 net profit was paid into its own free reserves to help finance investment. In the previous 10 years VW had received 80 pct of Audi's earnings as a dividend.     Habbel blamed the profit decline on disruptions to output caused by the introduction of the new Audi 80 model, on currency factors and on negative publicity in the U.S. About alleged "sudden acceleration" of some of its Audi 5000 models.     As reported, Audi's sales in the U.S. Dropped nearly 20 pct to 59,800 last year.     Habbel said the U.S. Sales decline would probably bottom out in 1987.     Audi's worldwide car deliveries fell two pct to 363,000.     Of the total, exports fell 10.5 pct to a rounded 210,000, but domestic sales increased to a rounded 154,000 from 137,180 in 1985.     Habbel said the new Audi 80 had sold extremely well in the first two months of 1987, helping Audi to increase its overall market share in West Germany to 8.4 pct from 5.2 pct in the same months of 1986. Sales in Europe also rose but U.S. Sales fell further, he said without giving details. Worldwide deliveries in the first two months increased eight pct to 57,000.     Audi said in January that 1987 car production would rise to over 400,000 from 384,000 in 1986, when output had fallen compared with 1985's 392,000.     Habbel said Audi expected the rise in output to lead to further new hiring of employees.     At the end of 1986 Audi's workforce stood at a record 39,800, a rise of 3,400 over 1985.  REUTER ;

TEST;18-MAR-1987 10:53:29.43;U.K. BASE RATES WILL FALL AGAIN SOON, SAY ANALYSTS;     By Geert Linnebank, Reuters Today's modest half-point cut in U.K. Bank base lending rates to 10 pct signals the Bank of England's determination to maintain a cautious monetary stance, but financial markets appear set to force its hand, analysts said.     They said a further half-point cut in base rates to 9-1/2 pct was bound to occur within the next week and rates may shed a further half point soon if markets remain buoyant.     Earlier, markets were bracing for a one-point cut in rates after yesterday's budget set a sharp three billion stg reduction in 1987 government borrowing targets to four billion stg.     Sterling money market rates moved lower again, with the key three-month interbank rate down to 9-5/8 1/2 pct at the start of business from 9-11/16 9/16 yesterday, and sterling rallied to four-year highs against the dollar in very active trading.     Government bond prices also surged on the budget, with gains in excess of one point pushing yields on long-term paper below nine pct for the first time in nearly a year.     But today's smaller than expected rate cut appeared to have placated markets for now, analysts said. Money market rates recovered up to 1/4 point from earlier lows while both sterling and gilts came off highs as trading ground to a near halt.     Analysts said the slowdown was likely to be temporary, and the reappraisal of sterling assets by international investors was set to resume as early as tomorrow, leading to higher gilt prices, exchange rate advances and lower money market rates.     "Today's cut was slightly disappointing," said Bill Martin, chief U.K. Economist at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew. "The Bank of England is taking a very cautious line ... To temper the markets' first rush of blood to the head after the budget."     Analysts said the bank's move today to lend two-week cash to U.K. Discount houses at a lower 10 pct suggested it hoped to maintain the new rates for about that period of time.     The analysts agreed success would depend largely on how sterling performs in the near term.     Sharp rises in the pound's value could be checked initially through Bank of England intervention but eventually the gains would force the bank to cut interest rates rates again.     "The market seems to have accepted the modest cut for the time being," said Midland Bank treasury economist David Simmonds. "But I am sceptical that the bank will be able to hold up rates for long."     Simmonds said he saw sterling rising another two U.S. Cents this week from around 1.60 dlrs, forcing a rate cut by Friday.     Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan Securities, said "There is another half point to come in the near term, this week or next week at the latest...We see a whole point off base rates in the next two or three weeks."     Analysts stressed that apart from prestige, Britain had very little to gain from a sharp rise in sterling's exchange rate.     Martin, of Phillips and Drew, said the dampening effect of a sterling rise on consumer price inflation would not materialise for at least nine months while its hampering impact on manufactured exports would show almost immediately.     Analysts said the budget, featuring income tax cuts as well as cautious plans for public finances, had improved the chances of re-election for the Conservative government and probably advanced the election date. One must be held before June, 1988. Combined with overall good prospects for the U.K. Economy, this was likely to fuel a foreign rush on sterling-denominated assets, pushing the pound's value well above unofficial targets.     With mark-denominated investments largely out of favour because of low yields and a dull economic outlook, Chase's Marshall said "Sterling is simply the best game in town, especially after the budget, and demand will remain strong."

TEST;18-MAR-1987 11:06:57.29;ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN SHIPBUILDERS RECOVERY;     By Fumiko Fujisaki, Reuters Japan's ailing shipbuilding industry plans to refloat itself in a few years from the twin rocks of recession and a strong yen through capacity and workforce cuts and greater use of computers, industry sources told Reuters.     The salvage measures, which include a government-sponsored rationalisation program, are aimed at clawing back some of the market which Japan, the world leader, has lost to South Korea through currency and labour cost disadvantages, they said.     The sources said South Korea's yards are now some 35 pct more competitive than Japan's due to such factors.     The government plans to help the industry shed 20 pct of current capacity within two years through mergers and regrouping under legislation put before Parliament this month and likely to be approved by May or June, the sources said.     They said from September a semi-government body will assure repayment of about 50 billion yen in liabilities incurred through job losses and the sale of excess capacity, and another 30 billion for buying unneeded land and equipment.     Last Friday, the Shipbuilders Association of Japan applied to the Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to slash tonnage built to about half of total capacity for a year from April 1.     The commission has held several hearings with the industry and approval should be given this month, the sources said.     A clampdown on output over one or two years combined with a planned cost-cutting and streamlining program and state support should help Japanese yards recover their international competitiveness, they said.     Under the cartel proposals, 33 yards each capable of building ships of more than 10,000 gross tonnes would build a maximum of three mln compensated gross registered tonnes (CGRT) in 1987/88. This is about half of total capacity.     This will ease the cut-throat competition which forced most yards to sign orders below cost, the sources said.     The industry is likely to seek to renew the cartel for 1988/89 as the Transport Ministry sees new orders falling to 3.1 mln CGRT in 1988/89 from 3.3 mln in 1987/88, they said.     The rationalisation program includes a cut of 20,000 to 30,000 of the estimated 100,000 workers in the industry between 1986 and 1989.     Japanese yards topped world order books at end-December, followed by South Korea and Taiwan, according to Lloyd's Register of Shipping.     However, falling orders and declining international competitiveness due to the strong yen led to heavy losses in the industry, the sources said.     Four of Japan's six major heavy machinery and shipbuilding companies reported current deficits in the first half of the year to March 31 and five of them are expected to report current deficits for the whole of 1986/7, they said.     The shipbuilding companies' streamlining program will raise productivity to compete with South Korean yards which have also been hard hit by declining orders and low ship prices in recnt years, the sources said.     In Japan, no single yard leads the industry, resulting in fierce competition and slow progress in reducing capacity. The two largest firms -- Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd <MITH.T> and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd <JIMA.T> -- account for only 30 pct of ships built, the sources said.     "World shipowners hope Japanese yards can manage to ride out the recession as their technology is the best in the world," said an official at a major Japanese shipping company.     The Japanese merchant fleet, the largest after Liberia's, has no intention of shifting to other countries to buy ships, and this will encourage Japanese yards, the sources said.  REUTER ;

This would increase non-performing loans by about 380 mln dlrs and reduce income before taxes and net income by about 10 mln dlrs in the 1987 first quarter and 35 mln dlrs for the full year, company officials told a press briefing.     Loans to Brazil at 1986 year end totaled 474 mln dlrs, according to the annual report released at the briefing.     In February 1987, the Brazilian government, citing a declining level of foreign currency reserves, declared a moratorium on the payment of interest on the country's medium and long term debt obligations.     Continental said it may take similar action on its loans to Ecuador, which total 25 mln dlrs.

TEST;18-MAR-1987 12:18:57.48;UK MINISTER SAYS FARM TALKS CAN USE OECD STUDY;  U.K. Agriculture Minister Michael Jopling said an OECD study which calculates the level of domestic farm subsidies in industrial countries would be a good basis for global agriculture negotiations now underway.     The controversial study, which has not yet been released by the Paris-based OECD, has calculated a measure of farm subsidies called the the Producer Subsidy Equivalent, PSE, OECD sources in Paris said last month.     Jopling, in a speech to the Commodity Club yesterday, suggested the PSE be refined as a starting point for reducing domestic farm policies during the Uruguay round of trade negotiations begun under the world trade agreement GATT.     The OECD study shows that there are few countries which do not significantly subsidize farmers, Jopling said.     The OECD study attempts to measure all farm subsidies for the years 1979 through 1981.     Jopling qualified his endorsement of the PSE as a negotiating tool, however, by saying the European Community would want "credit" in the negotiations for recent actions taken to reform the Common Agricultural Policy.     Representatives of other industrial countries told Reuters they are more skeptical than the U.K. about the PSE concept.     An Australian trade official said Canberra has "grave technical reservations" about the use of the PSE calculations. U.S. officials said there are several shortcomings to the study including the necessity to update the calculations to reflect recent changes in farm programs worldwide.     The officials said the study may be released in May.  Reuter ;
TEST;18-MAR-1987 12:38:36.08;SUDANESE MINISTER PREDICTS DEBT DIFFICULTIES;     By Mohamed Elfatih Sidahmed, Reuters Sudan will find it difficult to meet scheduled debt repayments over the next five years, Finance Minister Beshir Omer has told parliament..     He said Sudan's foreign debt rose to 10.6 billion dlrs at the end of last year, an increase of 300 mln from 1985.     Omer said it "will be difficult, if not impossible" for Sudan to pay a scheduled 4.17 billion dlrs in principal and interest payments over the next five years.     He said Sudan had reached agreement with the Soviet Union and its East European allies to service half of its debts to them in commodities, with the rest in hard currency.     Western diplomatic and official sources in Khartoum say 32 pct of Sudan's total foreign debt is to the Soviet Union, the Eastern bloc and Arab countries.     Sudan is 450 to 500 mln dlrs in arrears to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which last year declared it ineligible for fresh loans.     The sources said Sudan, hit by a slump in export earnings and remittances from expatriate workers, had an annual debt liability of nearly 900 mln dlrs but set aside only some 200 mln dlrs to service debts in the fiscal year ending next June 30.     Sudan, its Treasury depleted by nearly four years of civil war in the south and the aftermath of the devastating 1984-85 drought, has a budget deficit of 2.86 billion pounds this fiscal year.     Diplomatic and official sources said Sudan was now only servicing debts owed to creditors bound by regulations banning them from extending fresh loans to recipients in arrears.     They said these included the U.S. Agency for International Development, the World Bank and its soft loan affiliate, the International Development Agency.     Sudan reached a framework rescheduling agreement in 1984 with Western government creditors of the Paris Club.     The sources said this pact was to have been followed by bilateral agreements, but fell through when Khartoum became unable to service debts in 1985.     A Bank of Sudan (Central Bank) spokesman said last month Khartoum was negotiating a freeze on interest payments with commercial banks, owed about two billion dlrs.     Sudan has not received fresh loans since 1985 and the sources said it was only getting grants at present. Hopes that foreign aid would finance 780 mln dlrs  of the 1.14 billion dlr budget deficit have been dashed, they added.     Sudanese officials said Prime Minister Sadeq al-Mahdi's government would shortly announce a four-year economic plan aimed at starting the country's recovery.     Details of the plan have not been made public. But the sources said it would be geared to generate agricultural exports and would need a substantial injection of fresh loans that Sudan hoped to receive from Gulf Arab states.  REUTER ;
TEST;18-MAR-1987 12:54:30.82;MONEY BROKER SOUGHT IN VOLKSWAGEN CURRENCY SCANDAL;  The state prosecutor investigating a suspected currency swindle which may have lost Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F> millions of dollars said he wanted to question a Frankfurt-based money broker.     Prosecutor Carl Hermann Retemeyer told Reuters the broker, Joachim Schmidt, may be able to shed light on the affair in which VW says it might have been defrauded of up to 480 mln marks.     No charges have been laid in what may turn out to be West Germany's largest known currency fraud.     The incident has led to political calls for tighter controls on the free-wheeling money and currency markets.     Retemeyer gave no further details of the investigation. His office understood that Schmidt was on a business trip.     A spokesman for the brokerage firm told Reuters that Schmidt had been expected back on Monday from the United States but had not returned yet, and his current whereabouts were not known.     Brokerage firms fulfill a middle-man function in currency and money markets, matching buy and sell orders between banks and other large customers who may prefer to remain anonymous.     The financial newsletter, Platow, said today the state prosecutor, called in when suspicion of fraud first came to light on February 18, had to date been able to find no evidence of personal enrichment by VW employees.     The newsletter reported on November 3 last year that VW had incurred losses in the "three-figure millions" because it had not protected itself against a fall in the value of the dollar.     This was denied at the time by VW executive board chairman Carl Hahn.     Financial director Rolf Selowsky resigned last week after news of the currency fraud, an executive has been fired and several others are suspended.     A Frankfurt business lawyer, Egon Geis, said yesterday that on February 10 he had offered VW information about the currency fraud and offered to provide a written confession by someone involved.     He said VW declined his offer, but the company says the tip was taken to top management and that Geis later met Hahn but failed to produce the document.  REUTER ;

TEST;18-MAR-1987 14:08:21.35;CONT'L ILLINOIS SEES MONTHS OF BRAZIL DEBT TALKS;  Continental Illinois Corp's <CIL> Chairman John Swearingen said he sees negotiations to reschedule Brazil's debt payments taking at least three to six months.     Brazil declared last month a moratorium on payment of interest on its medium- and long-term debts. The moratorium is expected to persist the entire time that debt scheduling talks are under way.     "I believe it will take three to six months, maybe longer, for an arrangement to be worked out to reschedule Brazil's debt," Swearingen told reporters at a press briefing.     "I think Brazil will pay its debts in the long run. Just how long the run is is anybody's guess," Swearingen said.     Earlier the bank holding company said Brazil's moritorium may force it to increase non-performing loans by 380 mln dlrs and reduce pretax and net income by 10 mln dlrs in the first quarter and 35 mln dlrs for the full year.     The bank will decide March 31 whether to characterize these loans as non-performing, William Ogden, chairman of the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co of Chicago, Continental's largest subsidiary, said in response to an inquiry.     Ogden said the moratoriums will affect both pretax and net income equally because the banking firm has tax credits to use.     Swearingen predicted an increase in operating profits for 1987 because he sees higher income and reduced expenses. Continental will reduce expenses through job cuts and reducing office rental costs. In 1986 it cut about 850 positions.     In 1986 it had net profits of 165.2 mln dlrs or 60 cts a share, up from 150.5 mln dlrs or 53 cts a share.     The bank transferred 459 mln dlrs of poor-quality loans and other assets to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, FDIC, during 1986. It can transfer bad loans under the terms of the 1984 restructuring agreement with the government.     The bank will transfer the remaining 460 mln dlrs that it is entitled to transfer to FDIC by September 26, 1987, Swearingen said. It will choose loans based on ultimate loss rather than their immediate effect on non-performing loans.     In 1986 the bank's loans to the Midwest's middle market rose 20 pct at a time of overall weak loan demand in the U.S.     Concerning banking acquisitions, Swearingen said the bank would like to buy additional suburban Chicago banks. In 1986 it bought three small suburban banks.     Swearingen said he is concerned that Continental will be taken over because no bank in the Midwest region is large enough to buy it, and New York money center banks are prohibited by law from buying Illinois banks.     He said, however, that the FDIC still has control over who will eventually own the firm because it still holds the equivalent of 148 mln common shares out of a total 215 mln.     The FDIC sold 52 mln shares to the public last year and has said it intends to sell the rest as quickly as possible. The agency received the shares as part of its 4.5 billion dlrs 1984 bailout of the bank.     Swearingen, who came out of retirement in 1984 to head the struggling banking firm after a career as an oil industry executive, said he will retire when the three-year period he agreed to be Continental chairman ends in August. He would not comment on a successor.     The bank will expand its First Options of Chicago options clearning unit into Tokyo, Swearingen said, but said its doubtful lending to Japan will occur because that country doesn't need external sources of cash.

TEST;18-MAR-1987 15:19:46.57;LAIDLAW TRANSPORTATION <LDMFA> SEES BETTER YEAR;  Laidlaw Transportation Ltd said earnings per share for the current fiscal year should increase by "substantially more" than the 30 pct average annual growth experienced in the last four years.     Revenues for the year ended August 31 will be about 1.2 billion dlrs, including GSX Corp, the U.S. waste services unit acquired from Imasco Ltd last year for 358 mln dlrs, Laidlaw president Michael de Groote told analysts.     Last year, Laidlaw had operating earnings of 66.2 mln dlrs, or 63 cts per share, on revenues of 717.8 mln dlrs.     De Groote also said the company expects "excellent results" in the second quarter ended February 28, but would not be more specific.     He said his revenue estimate for fiscal 1987 does not include possible further acquisitions and said that the addition of GSX will produce increasing benefits in fiscal 1988 through fiscal 1990.     De Groote said the increased earnings in the previous four quarters was due partly to internal growth of about 15 pct. The rest came from acquisitions, he said.     Laidlaw expects to sell a small rubber recycling operation, a subsidiary of GSX, within the next few weeks, but this will not make any material contribution to earnings, de Groote said.     He also said he is "not very optimistic" about the ongoing negotiations to buy 50 pct of Tricil Ltd, a Toronto-based chemical and solid waste services company with Canadian and U.S. operations, from <Trimac Ltd> of Calgary.     De Groote said that, regardless of the outcome of the proposed Tricil acquisition, Laidlaw will decide within the next 30 days whether to stay in the North American chemical waste business through GSX Corp.     "We feel it is a profitable business with good growth potential and we now want to stay in it if we can get the right management," de Groote said.     Laidlaw financed the acquisition of GSX by its U.S. subsidiary, Laidlaw Transportation Inc, with the proceeds of a 200 mln Canadian dlr preferred stock issue and borrowing.     De Groote said the company will gain about 138 mln dlrs in cash by August 31 from the exercise of warrants.     De Groote also said waste services in fiscal 1987 will represent about 49 pct of revenues, school buses will contribute 49 pct and trucking about two pct.     The trucking subsidiary in western Canada is performing well and there are no plans to sell it, he said.     He would not estimate the contribution of each segment to earnings per share for the year. He also said that further acquisitions of school bus operations in the U.S. are likely within the next few months.  Reuter ;

TEST;18-MAR-1987 15:41:00.51;U.S. BANK INCOME SHOWS FIRST DROP IN 25 YEARS;  Problems in the farmbelt and oilpatch regions contributed to the first decline in overall income for U.S. banks in a quarter century, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) said.     The nation's 14,181 commercial banks had net income of 17.8 billion dlrs in 1986, down slightly from 1985's record 18.1 billion dlrs.     The total was still the second highest ever reported, but it was the first time income had not grown since 1961.     The figures reflected a radical split in the health of banks in the two halves of the country, the FDIC said.     In the East, one in 12 banks had losses last year, while one in four banks west of the Mississippi River had losses.     Nationwide, one out of five banks reported losses, the FDIC said in the first of a new series of quarterly banking profiles it planned to issue.     "I don't remember a time when there was such a clear distinction by geographic area," FDIC Chairman William Seidman told reporters.     He said that while the figures were not good, they showed the problem did not lie with the banking system as a whole but with regional differences in economic performance.     Some 44 banks have failed so far this year, twice as many as failed by this time a year ago, but Seidman said he doubted the pace would continue.      On a positive note, banks increased capital to a record 208 billion dlrs last year, and there has been a slowing in the number of new problem banks in all regions except the Southwest, Seidman said.     Banks' provision for losses from bad loans in the fourth quarter increased to 21.7 billion dlrs, a 23 pct rise from a year ago.     Large banks -- those with assets of one billion dlrs or more -- reporting fourth-quarter losses totaled 22, the FDIC said.     Seidman said it was too early to say what effect Brazil's moratorium on debt interest payments would have on U.S. banks.     He said bank deregulation had given managers more freedom to run their banks and that an increase in failures was to be expected.     But this freedom from regulatory restraints also has meant other banks that were better managed have gotten stronger, Seidman said.  Reuter ;

Greenmail often involves the repurchase of shares at a premium by a company from an unwanted investor. GenCorp today received a surprise tender offer from a group that holds 9.8 pct of its stock.     Gabelli also said GAMCO has sent a 13-D filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission on the 6.5 pct of GenCorp stock held by GAMCO and its affiliates.     The stock amounts to 1,462,000 shares and most of it was reported in an earlier 13-G filing. A 13-G is filed by passive investors to show holdings of more than five pct.     Earlier today, General Partners, owned by Wagner and Brown and AFG Industries Inc, launched a 100 dlr per share tender offer for GenCorp. Analysts said the offer was between 10 and 20 dlrs per share too low.     GenCorp has made no comment on the offer.

TEST;18-MAR-1987 16:48:44.49;AIR CANADA COURIER BUY SHARPLY ALTERS INDUSTRY;     By Larry Welsh, Reuters Air Canada's 54 mln U.S. dlr acquisition of Gelco Corp's <GEC> Canadian unit has dramatically altered Canada's fast growing courier industry, largely dominated by U.S. companies until this year, company officials and analysts said.     State-owned Air Canada takes over the country's second largest overnight courier business just two months after another Canadian company, <Onex Capital Corp Ltd>, approved the acquisition of number one ranked Purolator Courier Ltd from New Jersey-based Purolator Courier Corp <PCC>.     But analysts said the two acquisitions were prompted by financial restructuring undertaken by the U.S. parent companies and likely don't represent an industry trend toward buying out foreign owned courier operations.     "It's a case of whether you can buy from the right people at the right time," McLeod Young Weir Ltd transportation analyst Tony Hine commented.     The two acquisitions fit with a larger move by U.S. companies embroiled in a take-over or restructuring to sell-off their Canadian units to generate ready cash, said Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc analyst Harold Wolkin.     "There is a very good correlation between the U.S. parent selling Canadian subsidiaries and the U.S. parent either being under siege or taking someone else over," he said.     Gelco Corp, of Minnesota, decided to sell Gelco Express Ltd as part of its previously announced program to sell off four operating units to buy back shares and pay down debt, Gelco Express marketing vice president James O'Neil told Reuters.     The sale is the first under Gelco's divestiture program, and proceeds will be used to help pay down 350 mln U.S. dlrs of debt by year-end, the company said.     While company officials declined to disclose earnings and revenue figures, O'Neil said Gelco Express holds a dominant position in the industry, handling more than 50,000 packages a day and generating revenues of more than 100 mln Canadian dlrs a year.     The earlier move by Purolator to sell its Canadian unit formed an important part of a company restructuring program, adopted after another Canadian Company, <Unicorp Canada Corp>, acquired a 12.6 pct stake in Purolator and said it would consider acquiring the whole company.     Last month, Purolator agreed to be acquired by a company formed by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain managers of Purolator's U.S. courier business.     For Air Canada, its acquisition of Gelco's Canadian courier business represents an "excellent financial investment" in a market it sees growing by 25 to 30 pct annually, spokesman Esther Szynkarsky said.     The airline also announced it acquired a 65 pct stake in EMS Corp, of Calgary, an in-city messenger service.     It did not disclose financial terms, but Szynkarsky said the two acquisitions totalled about 90 mln Canadian dlrs, and the two business have combined yearly revenues of 170 mln dlrs.     She said the acquisition fit with Air Canada's strategy of seeking attractive investments that compliment its main airline business.     Gelco will continue to operate with current management, independently of Air Canada, although Air Canada already operates its own air cargo business that includes a small door-to-door courier operation.     "They're well run, they're a good investment, they're doing well in a growing market, and that's the way we want to keep it," Szynkarsky said.     Analyst Hine said the Gelco and Purolator Canadian units will likely retain operating links with their U.S. delivery network, generating traffic for the former parent companies without them having to tie up capital in Canada.     "The nature of the business is that incremental traffic is incremental revenue," Hine said.     "It's sort of a sausage maker business where you put in place the sausage grinder, and the more sausage you can stuff through, the more money you make," he added.  Reuter ;

Speaking to a House Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee, Amstutz cited three factors which have improved the wheat outlook.     He said world consumption of wheat is increasing by about 20 mln tonnes this year, primarily for feed use. There are also reports from Australia, Canada and Argentina that plantings have been reduced, he said. Furthermore, he cited reports of greater than normal winterkill in the Soviet Union.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, General Partners said proceeds from the sale of GenCorp's aerospace division would help it repay some of the debt it would incur in the 100 dlr a share cash tender offer.     General Partners, which launched the surprise tender offer today, said it already 2,180,608 shares of GenCorp, or 9.4 pct of the total outstanding common stock.     General Partners, which estimated the total cost of the takeover at 2.5 billion dlrs, also said it plans to continue GenCorp's policy of trying to settle Federal Communications Commission charges against two of its television and 12 radio station licenses.     It said it would also continue GenCorp's policy of trying to sell its New York-area television station WOR to MCA Inc <MCA> for 387 mln dlrs and its Los Angeles station KHJ to Walt Disney Co <DIS> for 217 mln dlrs.     But General Partners said it plans to keep GenCorp's headquarter in Akron, Ohio.     General Partners also said it would maintain GenCorp's plastics and industrial products division as well as tires and related products.     But it left open that it might make other changes in GenCorp's operations after it completes the merger.     Besides using 250 mln dlrs of its own equity for the tender offer, General Partners said it would seek one billion dlrs under a secured margin facility from Wells Fargo Bank N.A. and other banks. It also said it would seek 1.25 billion dlrs from the sale to Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc or its affiliates of senior subordinated promissory notes.     In a March 18 letter to GenCorp Chairman William Reynolds, which was included in the SEC filing, General Partners officials said they were "confident of our ability to promptly obtain the remaining funding as described in our offer materials."     "For this reason, we do not forsee any obstacles to a prompt consummation of the transaction," General Partners said.     Shearson is dealer manager of the General Partners offer for GenCorp.

TEST;18-MAR-1987 19:32:49.60;U.S. CARGO PREFERENCE FUNDING ACCORD SEEN NEAR;  The U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Transportation are close to agreement on how to fund the increasing share of food aid to be shipped on U.S. flag vessels under a 1985 farm bill provision on cargo preference.     Melvin Sims, USDA's general sales manager told a House Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee hearing that the two departments are negotiating a "memorandum of understanding" on cargo preference.     Under a 1985 farm bill provision, the percentage of food aid shipments carried on U.S. flag vessels was to gradually increase over three years to 75 pct in 1988. The increased cost of using U.S. vessels was to be funded by the Transportation Department instead of USDA. However, USDA officials said Transportation has so far contributed no money.     The agreement between USDA and Transportation is expected to resolve the matter, USDA officials said.     Tom Kay, administrator of the USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service said yesterday the requirement that more food aid shipments be carried on U.S. vessels has been difficult to meet.     "As the tonnage (required under cargo preference) goes up, its going to be harder and harder to meet," Kay said.     Two farm state Congressmen, Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) and Glenn English (D-Okla.) said cargo preference makes U.S. farm export programs more costly and the program should be eliminated.     In the past, farm interests opposed to cargo preference have been defeated in Congress by the maritime interests who view cargo preference as vital to the U.S. shipping fleet.  Reuter ;

TEST;19-MAR-1987 06:03:28.02;ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - SAUDI ARABIA RESHAPES ECONOMY;     By Stephen Jukes, Reuters Higher world oil prices, coupled with a new realism ushered in by austerity, could lift Saudi Arabia's economy after five years of falling revenue and growing budget deficits, bankers and diplomats said.     The months ahead will prove critical as the government attempts a balancing act between defending higher oil prices and fostering recovery through a bigger role for the private sector.     Economists said oil earnings could recover this year to about 20 billion dlrs and nominal gross domestic product could grow by about three pct, the first rise since 1982.     But the economists said this will be possible only if the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) succeeds in defending world oil prices and if Saudi Arabia is not forced to curtail output for too long.     Saudi Arabia is now keeping production down to defend OPEC's newly-established 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price.     Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters output is running at about three mln barrels per day (bpd), well down on Saudi Arabia's OPEC quota of 4.13 mln set for the first half of 1987.     King Fahd has stamped his personal authority on OPEC's new-found determination to defend prices in a move Western diplomats believe underlines the kingdom's need to secure a stable source of income for its economy.     Saudi Arabia, still the world's largest oil exporter, is a hugely wealthy country. But the past five years of declining revenue have taken their toll. Economists estimate gross domestic product fell 10 pct last year and 8.6 pct in 1985.     Oil revenue last year, when prices briefly dipped below 10 dlrs per barrel, probably totalled no more than 17.5 billion dlrs, compared to a peak 101.8 billion in 1981.     "Austerity is still the watchword, but Saudi Arabia will not be allowed to dip further into recession ... The Saudis can afford to draw down reserves temporarily to offset the worst effects," a diplomat said.     In the short-term, the kingdom can lessen the impact of lower oil revenues and a gaping budget deficit by drawing on foreign reserves, still put at around 100 billion dlrs.     But such a policy cannot be pursued indefinitely. Bankers and diplomats said it would amount to fiscal recklessness in the longer term.     It also increases the dominance of the public sector at a time when the government is publicly urging private enterprise to take over the lead role in the economy.     Bankers and diplomats said the government is well aware of the risks attached to this policy but is determined to "tough it out" on the oil front even if that means a short-term depletion of reserves.     The 1987 budget deficit is targetted at a huge 52.7 billion riyals or 31 pct of total outlay. The budget explicitly recognises the need to draw down reserves while foreign borrowing has been ruled out.     Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim told Saudi businessmen this week the government had carefully considered the need to stimulate the economy when drawing up its budget plans late last year.     "It therefore took the bold step of withdrawing more than 50 billion riyals from its reserves and pumping it into the economy," he said.     Reserves were built up during the late 1970's and early 1980's when Saudi Arabia's breakneck pace of construction and tales of high spending became legendary.     The shrinking economy has wrought huge changes in the fabric of the Kingdom's private sector where poor management had gone unpunished in the easy days of the oil boom.     Modern techniques of cost control have been introduced, markets expanded and outsized labour forces and inventories cut back. The expatriate workforce has fallen sharply.     The number of new bankruptcies appears to be declining but Saudi banks, hit hard by non-performing loans to the corporate sector, have become highly selective in extending new credit.     Government moves to encourage lending and investigate company complaints about late public sector contract payments could boost confidence but recession has slowed the nation's industrialisation program and discouraged foreign investment.     Private wealth is still very high and banks report more and more cash being placed on deposit.     As Saudi Arabia attempts to shift the weight of economic development from the public to the private sector, one of the biggest tasks will be to convince businessmen to channel personal savings into industrial projects within the kingdom and refrain from the temptation to invest abroad.

In January, seasonally adjusted unemployment fell by a revised 1,100 to 11.3 pct, it said. Initially the January position was reported as flat.     The unadjusted jobless total, including school leavers, fell to 3.23 mln, or 11.7 pct, from 3.30 mln, 11.9 pct, in January.     February was the seventh successive month that seasonally adjusted unemployment registered a fall.     It was at a peak of 11.7 pct last summer.     Lord Young, the Employment Minister, said there appeared little doubt the monthly fall, which has been running at about 20,000, will continue.

TEST;19-MAR-1987 08:07:29.71;U.S. DELEGATION HOPES FOR VEG OILS TAX DEFEAT;  American soybean producers and processors are hoping the proposed EC tax on vegetable oils and fats will not be imposed, but say the U.S. Is prepared to retaliate if it is introduced.     Wayne Bennett, the American Soybean Association's first vice president, told a news conference the U.S. Administration would not hesitate to retaliate, but both producers and processors were trying to solve the issue through negotiation.     U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng said in a letter to EC officials that U.S. Retaliatory measures would cover more than agricultural products if the tax was imposed, Bennett said.     The ASA and National Soybean Processors Association (NSPA) delegations will meet top West German government officials today and tomorrow to lobby for support.     Bennett said West Germany, Britain, the Netherlands, Denmark and Portugal oppose the tax, but Italy and Belgium seem to have taken a hardline view on the issue.     "Europeans in favour of the tax say it would be to their advantage economically, but that is not correct because we would hit back," NSPA chairman Jack Reed said.     This step would be very expensive for all and no one would emerge as a winner if the tax were introduced, he said.     Reed pointed out the U.S. Administration and the soybean industry view the EC proposal as violating the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.     The proposed tax also violates the zero duty bindings agreed between the EC and U.S. In 1962, he said.     Under the zero duty bindings pact U.S. Soybeans and products can be exported to the Community duty-free.  REUTER ;

It said it made the disclosure in two prospectuses filed today with the Ontario Securities Commission.     CDC said one prospectus covers a planned issue of units to raise up to 30 mln dlrs for subsidiary Canterra Energy Ltd's 1987 exploration spending. A second prospectus relates to a planned public sale of four mln common shares which CDC sold privately to an unidentified investor in December.     CDC said the unit offering will consist of a maximum of 18,750 units priced at 1,600 dlrs each. Each unit will comprise an interest in CDC Flow-Through limited partnership and common shares of Canterra which will be exchanged for CDC common shares.     Through a series of transactions, investors will receive 100 common shares of CDC for each unit, representing a price of 16 dlrs a common share. They will also get rights to income tax deductions equal to the price of each unit.     Agents for the sale are Wood Gundy Inc and Dominion Securities Inc.                           Reuter ;

In an earlier statement, TransAmerican said, Coastal claimed its rights to file a reorganization planhad been affirmed by the court. "Coastal claims they have standing, but no final determinatioon has been made," TransAmerican said.     The company said various Coastal subsidiaries have made unsecured claims totaling 700,000 dlrs which are disputed by Transamerican.     The company said it has a claim against Coastal's Coastal States Trading Inc subsidiary for almost three mln dlrs. This claim resulted by a breach of contract in the trading company's failure to provide crude oil to the Good Hope Refinery in Louisiana which was operated by TransAmerican's predecessor company, <GHR Energy Inc>.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mark IV said its top officials told Baird executives at a March 17 meeting that while Mark IV may buy more Baird common stock, it presently intends to hold it to the 25 pct limit.     Mark IV, which first disclosed its stake and interest in Baird on March 10, has reported it holds 391,800 Baird common shares, or 17.6 pct of the total outstanding.     Mark IV said it also agreed at the meeting that if it decides to seek control of Baird, it would be through a negotiated merger or business combination or through a tender offer in which Baird would have at least 24 hours notice.     Baird, in turn, agreed not to take any defensive measures without giving Mark IV at least 24 hours notice, it said.     Baird also confirmed that a takeover defense plan it already has which is triggered by the accumulation of more than 25 pct of its stock, would not be triggered by a tender offer, Mark IV said.

TEST;19-MAR-1987 14:49:41.34;UK CROSS FIELD PRT RELIEF FAVOURS SMALLER FIELDS;  The "cross field allowance" relief on Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) announced by U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson this week will favour smaller non-PRT paying fields, according to stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co.     The cross field allowance offsets up to 10 pct of qualifying spending on a new oil field against PRT liability of other fields. It is restricted to new offshore developments outside the southern basin and yet to gain Annex B approval.     A report by the stockbrokers said that on a new field not paying PRT due to its small size, the relief would directly benefit in PRT saving on an existing field.     "The cross field allowance will mainly benefit participators in those fields which have no PRT liability," the report said, adding that the timing of development of such fields may be advanced.     The government would in effect be subsidising these developments at 7.5 pct of capital expenditure before corporation tax, the report said.     On fields likely to pay PRT in the future, the benefit is of timing. Although liabilities on other existing fields will be reduced immediately, liabilities on larger new fields will rise in the future due to the loss of offsets, it said.     In a study on probable fields, the report said that when the rates of return are examined, the rise for a PRT-paying field such as Miller, the largest undeveloped oil field in the U.K. North Sea, is from 18.7 to 19 pct, while the rise for a small non-PRT paying field such as Kittiwake is 15.9 to 17.9 pct.     The report added that in fields which pay PRT, there will be a cost in being able to have this early relief. Not only will these costs be unavailable for offset against the field's future profits, but uplift of some 35 pct on these costs will be lost.     Thus, a saving of PRT of 100 when field development starts will have to be matched by a rise in PRT of 135 at a later time.  Reuter ;

TEST;19-MAR-1987 15:35:29.49;TALKING POINT/AMERICAN EXPRESS <AXP>;     By Patti Domm, Reuters American Express Co's plan to sell a stake in its Shearson Lehman Brothers is believed to be a prelude to a public offering of shares in the brokerage unit, analysts said.     American Express earlier said it has a general understanding with Nippon Life Insurance Co of Japan to sell a 13 pct interest in Shearson for 530 mln dlrs.     The statement triggered a rise in other brokerage stocks, as investors speculated on the possibility of more investment in the U.S. brokerage industry by Japanese concerns.     The stocks of brokerage firms also climbed in response to the relatively high value Nippon put on its stake in the U.S. firm. Analysts said the 530 mln dlrs for 13 pct represents a price of 2.7 times book value.     Perrin Long of Lipper analytical said the brokerage stocks, depressed somewhat by the dark cloud of the U.S. insider trading scandal, closed out February at a market value of 1.8 times book value.     American Express was trading today at 78-1/4, off 3/8. For the last several weeks, the stock has been strong on rumors of a spinoff of part of Shearson.     Analysts said American Express and its Shearson unit will benefit from the doors Nippon Life can open to the increasingly important Tokyo financial markets.     "I think this, in all honesty, is a preliminary step," said Long.     "What you will see probably in the future is American Express selling an additional 17 pct in the public market and have a public vehicle for Shearson," Long said.     "Normally, investors do not make a major capital commitment into an illiquid situation," he said of Nippon.     Some analysts previously speculated a 20 pct stake in Shearson might be sold to the public. They said the firm, like other investment banks, needs capital to expand globally.     American express has said the total employees of shearson will expand by 20 pct in 1987 internationally. However, that number is substantially lower than growth last year, a company spokesman said.     American Express officials would not comment beyond a statement made this morning. That statement, however, did not close off the possibility of a public offering or other option for Shearson.     David Anthony, a Smith Barney analyst, said it is possible Shearson would be partially sold to the public. But he believes the firm will digest the Nippon investment first.     "I think they'll figure out what they're going to do with the money they have," he said.     Joan Goodman, an analyst with Pershing and Co, also said American Express could determine to sell shares to the public.     In its statement, the financial services giant said it is continuing to study various plans for Shearson in addition to the investment by Nippon.     American Express said options under study range from expanding Shearson's capacity to meet international competition to broadening its access to capital.     American Express also said the options reflect the continuing integral role of Shearson in American Express' worldwide financial services strategy.     Shearson follows Goldman, Sachs and Co in finding a Japanese partner. Goldman last year sold a 12.5 pct stake to Sumitomo Bank in exchange for a 500 mln dlr capital infusion.     Analysts speculated there will be more such matches.     "Those (U.S. brokers) companies have the expertise. They don't have the money. There's just not enough internal capital growth," said Wertheim analyst James Hanbury, who follows other U.S. brokerage companies.     Hanbury said some Japanese companies, flush with cash, are interested in the expertise of American brokers. "Those (Japanese) companies have the capital and our companies have the capital needs and the growth opportunities to use the money. That's a nice marriage," he said.     Morgan Stanley and Co <MS> rose 4-1/4 to 74-7/8. First Boston Corp <FBC> was up one to 51-1/4. E.F. Hutton Group <EFH> rose 1-1/4 to 41-1/8, and PaineWebber Group <PWJ> climbed 7/8 to 37-3/4.

TEST;19-MAR-1987 16:32:06.12;U.S. BANK DISCOUNT BORROWINGS 228 MLN DLRS;  U.S. bank discount window borrowings less extended credits averaged 228 mln dlrs in the week to Wednesday March 18, the Federal Reserve said.     Total borrowings in the week rose 83 mln dlrs to 502 mln dlrs, with extended credits up three mln dlrs at 274 mln dlrs. The week was the first half of a two-week statement period. Net borrowing in the prior week averaged 148 mln dlrs.     Commenting on the two-week statement period that ended on March 11, the Fed estimated that banks had daily average net free reserves of 759 mln dlrs rather than the 660 mln dlrs first reported.     A Fed spokesman told a press briefing that there were no large single day net misses in the Fed's reserve projections in the first week of the latest bank statement period.     None of the 14 large money center banks borrowed from the discount window during the week and all of the Wednesday borrowing was made by the smallest banks. For the week as a whole, the borrowing was split roughly evenly between the large regionals and the small banks.     Natural float ranged from a low of near zero on Thursday -- for which the Fed spokesman could give no particular reason -- to a high of nearly 750 mln dlrs on Tuesday.     The Tuesday peak included about 100 mln dlrs of transportation float in mid- and south-Atlantic states. Noting that the weather was "basically good" for March, the spokesman said that transportation float averaged under 500 mln dlrs a day for the full week.     Float related as-ofs were a negative 400 mln dlrs on Wenesday due to a number of unrelated cash letter error corrections in five districts.     As-ofs peaked at just over 500 mln dlrs on Tuesday.

The debentures due 1998, were issued in 1984 and were zero coupon notes for the first five years. Beginning 1990, they were to receive semi-annual interest payments at an annual rate of 16 pct.     Morgan said the complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, stems from the recent voluntary liquidation of Metromedia which has intentionally created an event of default on the notes.      The company said the default amount is 574.24 dlrs for each 1,000 dlrs principal amount of debentures.

TEST;19-MAR-1987 17:47:11.05;EC OFFICIAL FAULTS U.S. TRADE BILL;  Sir Roy Denman, Head of the EC Delegation in Washington, said pending U.S. trade legislation is a misguided attempt to deal with the nation's trade deficit and will spark retaliation if passed in its present form.     "To think that you can deal with a trade deficit by legislation is a mistake," he told the Foreign Trade Association here.     Denman told reporters that possible retaliation, which he warned of in a letter to House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, would not necessarily be on a product-for-product basis.     "Retaliation does not have to be matched product to product," Denman said.     He said in the case of textiles import restrictions, however, retaliation would be against U.S. textile exports.     "Certainly, if restrictions were imposed on European exports of textiles to the U.S., the Community would be likely to retaliate with restrictions on U.S. textile exports to Europe," Denman said.     He also took exception to U.S. proposals to require countries with large current account surpluses with the U.S. to cut those surpluses or face special tariffs.     "This would conflict with international obligations, throw a large wrench into the current round of trade negotiations and could easily boomerang," he warned of the tariff proposals.     Denman also took exception to U.S. efforts to seek reciprocity in specific trade sectors.     "Forcing reciprocity in one sector by imposing barriers would simply lead to retaliation from the other party," he said, adding that overall reciprocity can only be achieved by trading off disadvantages in one sector for advantages in another.

TEST;19-MAR-1987 18:03:13.06;GM <GM> PARTS WORKERS TO VOTE ON CONTRACT;  Workers at a General Motors Corp parts plant in Michigan are scheduled to vote tomorrow on a new contract that would change the way many of the workers do their job.     Some 3,000 members of the United Auto Workers at GM's Livonia, Mich., parts plant will vote in two shifts on a local contract to replace their current agreement with the company, according to officials of both the union and the company.     The proposed accord would initiate the so-called "team concept" at the plant, which makes seat cushions and is part of GM's Inland Division.     Under the proposed contract, workers in one area of the plant would be responsible for the entire product and would make some of their own decisions about assembling that product, said Kevin Woodward, a steward with the UAW local that represents the workers.     An Inland division spokesman would not discuss details of the accord. But he said Inland has a "serious" capacity problem.     No wage or benefit issues are in the proposal. Those issues are covered by a national pact between GM and the UAW. Talks on a new national accord are expected to begin in July.     If the contract is ratified, it would go into effect as soon as the vote count is completed, said Ronald Catcher, a member of the local's executive board.     The pact would also stay in place through the next national contract, he said.     Catcher said the union members are sharply divided on the new accord. "It's going to be close either way," he said.     Many of the workers are afraid that, if the agreement is not ratified, the plant will be shut down, union officials said.

A decision on how to renegotiate will be taken at the ISO six monthly session in May. The alternatives are between an autumn London conference for another pact without economic clauses, but a different voting and budgetary structure, or a Geneva-based conference next year for a new pact with economic clauses, he said.     But delegates said the latter would only be considered if the world's four major exporters -- Australia, Brazil, Cuba and the European Community -- can resolve differences over how prices can best be supported and how to share the world     Today's special session was called because the U.S. earlier indicated it would only be able to pay 56 pct of its share of the ISO budget.     At today's council session Politoff said the U.S. would try and find a way to pay the balance of about 50,000 stg later this year. Currently, about three quarters of this year's ISO 800,000 stg budget has not been paid but delegates said the U.S. caused controversy as it said it might not pay its full contribution in the last year of the current pact.     The Soviet Union has called for changes to the way the ISO budget is shared out. Currently it is halved between importers and exporters and the Soviet Union has a 30 pct share of the importer half. The Soviets want a new sugar pact to have only a single category of members who would all share the costs pro rata to their share of world sugar trade.

TEST;19-MAR-1987 20:23:10.65;REAGAN SAYS U.S. STILL PROBING ACID RAIN PROBLEM;  President Reagan said the U.S. government is still looking into the problem of acid rain.     "We're still investigating this," he told a nationally televised news conference.     Reagan added that the government will now work with U.S. industry to help address the problem.     However, he declined to endorse the writing of federal standards for emissions that would help alleviate the problem.     The Reagan administration yesterday announced a 2.5 billion dlr, five-year program to deal with acid rain, a problem that troubles U.S. relations with Canada.     Reagan was asked by a reporter whether the government should set emission standards.     He responded that the deeper that officials went in examining the acid rain problem, the more complex it appeared.     He said the government did not want to rush into adopting a measure that might ultimately prove fruitless.  Reuter ;
TEST;19-MAR-1987 22:20:52.17;BOLIVIAN MINERS CALL GENERAL STRIKE;  About 9,000 miners employed by the state corporation, Comibol, declared a general strike as from midnight (0400 gmt) to press for higher salaries, a statement by the federation for Bolivian mine workers said.      It said the strike was called to defend the nationalised mining industry. The miners were willing to negotiate with the government of President Victor Paz Estenssoro, but only if it showed an intention to meet the strikers' demands.      The government said the strike was designed to cause it embarrassment during the four-day visit of West German President Richard Von Weizsaecker, which starts on Friday.     The miners statement said police had violently evicted Comibol office workers in the city of Oruro after they began a hunger strike yesterday.     The government has sacked about 20,000 miners from its deficit-ridden corporation since the collapse in the international price of tin. The lay-offs represent about two-thirds of the original workforce.  REUTER ;

Istat said there were 20 working days in January, the same as December, but one fewer than January last year.     Istat said the year-on-year fall reflected poorer performances in the footwear, clothing, textiles, chemicals and metals industries.     It said office machinery and data sectors, wood and furniture, precision mechanics, oil and electricity showed improved activity.

The LCE's six week trial system starts on April 1, with buyers and sellers filling in slips which carry not only the transaction, but also the date and time of execution.     These slips will then have to be forwarded to market staff for entering into International Commodities Clearing House (ICCH) terminals within 15 minutes of the trade being transacted, the spokeswoman said.     The IPE system is similar, although here traders will use time-stamping machines which automatically enter the date, as is the practice on futures exchanges in the U.S. And on the London International Financial Futures Exchange.

TEST;20-MAR-1987 09:20:17.13;EC AND COMECON ENDS TALKS WITH PROGRESS;     By Stephanie Nebehay, Reuters The European Community (EC) and Soviet-led Comecon ended talks here, having made progress on setting up formal trade relations, but no breakthrough because of Comecon's refusal to recognise West Berlin as part of the EC, delegates said.     Negotiators were trying to reach agreement on the draft of a joint declaration setting up official relations after 30 years of mutual non-recognition. John Maslen, head of the EC delegation, told Reuters as he emerged from the final session: "We made some progress, but we have called for another meeting."     Officials, who asked not to be named, said the Comecon team had refused to accept a clause in the draft declaration which would recognise West Berlin as part of the 12-nation EC.     Under the 1957 Treaty of Rome all contracts and agreements signed by the Community must contain this territorial clause stipulating West Berlin is an integral part of the EC. An EC negotiator taking part in the three-day talks said: "We wanted the territorial clause in, but Comecon said no."     A joint statement issued after the talks said progress was made towards clarifying positions, but another meeting would be necessary to complete the work.     Any decision in principle to set up relations would require approval by the Community's Council of Ministers and by the executive committee of Comecon.     Zdzislaw Kuroski, deputy director of Comecon, who heads the East bloc delegation, told Reuters ahead of today's session: "We have narrowed our differences on a range of questions, but not on all questions."     Asked whether Comecon would accept EC insistence that any joint declaration stipulate West Berlin as part of the Community, he replied: "This question is not contained in the draft which our side presented."     West German diplomats said they would insist on including the clause on West Berlin in any EC-Comecon agreement.     The talks followed an earlier round between the two trading blocs here last September and the first-ever direct talks between the EC and the Soviet Union on establishing diplomatic relations in January.     The EC trades with individual Comecon member states despite non-recognition of Comecon. Last year, the EC had a five billion dlr trade deficit with East European states, about half the deficit of the previous year, due to a drop in the price of Soviet oil imported by the EC.  REUTER ;

TEST;20-MAR-1987 10:44:12.18;BANK OF FINLAND TO TRADE IN BANKS' CERTIFICATES;  The Bank of Finland said it has started dealings in banks' certificates of deposits (CDs) with immediate effect and that it was prepared to issue its own paper to stimulate operations on the domestic money market.     Bank of Finland Governor Rolf Kullberg told a news conference the Bank will also limit credits on the call money market from March 30, 1987, by introducing a maximum credit amount and a penalty rate if banks exceed this ceiling.     "The recent introduction of three-month money and these new regulations are decreasing the role of the call money market and the discount rate as monetary instruments," Kullberg said.     Bankers welcomed the central bank measures saying these were needed to accelerate the domestic money market. The Bank of Finland had never before been allowed to issue its own CDs, they said.     "The central bank for the first time has an instrument with which it really can influence the price of money in this country," one banker said.     Under the new rules banks are limited to call money credits to a maximum of 7.5 pct of the total of their equity capital and cash reserves. A penalty rate of interest of 19 pct is now introduced if the limit is exceeded.     Director Sixten Korkman at the Bank of Finland's monetary department said he expected the bank to pursue an active policy on the interbank market as an issuer of own-CDs.     "We are free to do it, so maybe on Monday we will issue the first, just to see how the system functions. Overall I think we will issue at least a few times a week," Korkman told Reuters.     He said the bank was likely to aim at CDs with a three-month maturity at first as the market was best developed for paper of that maturity.     The Bank of Finland introduced last December three-month credits and deposits at rates determined by the central bank and the commercial banks as a shift away from the traditional overnight call money market.     Liquidity on the call credit market has fallen from around nine billion markka in early December to 167 mln last week, while three-month credits have risen to three to four billion.     On the interbank market there has been an increasing trade in banks' CDs, estimated to be some eight billion markka. In addition, commercial paper accounts for around five billion markka and Treasury Bills two billion.  REUTER ;

Jean-Paul Dessertine, international director at BUE, said the function of the proposed joint financial group, would be to help set up, with consulting and financial services, other Franco-Soviet, mainly industrial, joint ventures.     Some protocols of intent have already been signed but no joint venture contracts have been finalised under the new laws.     Dessertine said a joint working party would on April 15 begin consulting with companies interested in making joint ventures, and work to set up the joint financial holding.     Citing the mixed results of joint ventures set up in the past between western and East European countries, he said:     "This is a wager on the evolution of the Soviet Union, and on how far new reforms will be applied."     Other parties to the cooperation protocol are <Banque Commerciale pour l'Europe du Nord>, a French subsidiary of Gosbank, and <Compagnie Financiere de Credit Industriel et Commercial>, the parent company of BUE.

Frederick Grede, CBT vice president of administration and planning, told the Futures Industry Association that rules proposed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, would "handicap the ability of U.S. exchanges and futures commission merchants to compete internationally."     The CFTC rules generally would require additional registration and disclosure.     Grede said that speculative positions, hedging and aggregation do not exist on most overseas exchanges, and that the regulations would impose onerous requirements relating to the segregation of customer funds.

The company said the slower than expected removal of the fuel, which has been primarily due to the water-clarity problems, is now expected to extend fuel removal into 1988.     A spokesman said the company had previously expected this to be completed by the end of 1987 and has not estimated how far into 1988 the process will extend. It still expects to complete the entire clean-up by the end of 1988, he added.     GPU said its auditors, Coopers and Lybrand, again qualified its opinion of GPU's financial statements, adding the recovery of TMI-2 decommissioning costs to the unresolved issues leading to the qualified opinion.

TEST;20-MAR-1987 16:17:42.42;EC AGREES REDUCTION OF DIESEL EXHAUST EMISSIONS;  The European Community (EC) agreed tough new rules to cut diesel exhaust emissions from trucks and buses in an attempt to reduce air pollution threatening vast stretches of the region's forests.     Diplomats said EC environment ministers meeting here agreed member states would have to reduce by 20 pct over the next few years the emission of nitrogen oxide, widely seen as the main source of acid rain endangering forests and lakes.     The reduction would be compulsory for heavy vehicles, with tougher standards imposed for new models from April 1988 and for all new vehicles from October 1990.     The EC's executive Commission says the emission level of nitrogen oxide was expected to drop to 2.4 mln tonnes a year from three mln tonnes within the 12-nation Community if all heavy vehicles applied to the new standards.     There are an estimated nine mln lorries and buses in use in the EC, according to Commission figures.     The ministers also gave West Germany a go-ahead to move towards a ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol, after Bonn requested permission to do so to encourage the use of low-pollution cars, diplomats said.     West Germany will still need ministers' final approval for such a plan. Diplomats said this was expected when EC environment ministers meet next on May 21.     But the ministers added that the go-ahead for West Germany did not mean there would automatically follow a Community-wide ban on the sale of regular leaded petrol.     Bonn intends to keep leaded premium petrol pumps, diplomats said. They added that, of the 97 mln cars in the EC, only 20 mln now ran on regular leaded petrol and these would risk no damage if they switched over to premium leaded petrol.     Under EC law, ministers have to give member states special permission if they wish to be exempt from Community competition laws. This would be the case if West Germany were to implement a ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol.  Reuter ;

TEST;21-MAR-1987 00:49:21.32;MAIN FEATURES OF NEW RUBBER PACT;  The new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA), like the 1979 pact, will use a buffer stock as the sole instrument for market intervention -- excluding export quotas or production controls.     The new INRA was adopted yesterday at a session held under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).     In many respects the main features in the new pact resemble those contained in the present one.     The reference price, currently 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cts per kilo, will be maintained -- unless between now and October 22, when the 1979 INRA expires, the average of the daily market indicator price remains above the upper intervention ("may sell") price (231 cts) or below the lower intervention ("may buy") price (171 cts) for six months.     If this happened -- but delegates said it was unlikely considering that the present indicator price averages 196 cts -- the price would be revised under the current accord by five pct or by whatever amount the International Natural Rubber Council decides.     The new reference price would then be taken over for the new agreement.     Under the same circumstances in the new pact the reference price would be automatically revised by five pct unless the Council decides on a higher percentage.     Similarly, if buffer stock purchases or sales amounting to 300,000 tonnes have been made since the last revision, the reference price will be lowered or raised by three pct unless the Council decides on a higher percentage.     Another change introduced in the new INRA is that price reviews will be held at 15-month intervals instead of 18.     Those changes are intended to make the reference price more responsive to market trends.     As in the present accord the "may buy" and "may sell" levels are set at plus or minus 15 pct of the reference price, and the "must buy" and "must sell" levels at 20 pct of it.     The lower and upper indicative prices (floor and ceiling prices) will remain fixed at 150 and 270 cents, unless the Council decides to revise them at reviews held every 30 months.     During the negotiations, consumers abandoned a proposal that the floor price be adjusted downward if the buffer stock, currently 360,000 tonnes, rose to 450,000 tonnes.     The maximum size of the buffer stock in the new pact is the same as under the present one -- 400,000 tonnes, with provision for an additional contingency buffer stock of 150,000 tonnes.     Under the new accord, the contingency buffer stock will be brought in at 152 cts to defend the floor price.     At last Friday's session, Ahmed Farouk, speaking for producers, said producing nations considered that the 1979 pact had served the purpose for which it had been created.     Gerard Guillonneau of France, who spoke for consumers, agreed that the current agreement had worked "relatively well."     Asked about the chances of success of the new INRA, delegates noted that for nearly its whole life, the 1979 accord had maintained the average price above the "must buy" level.     They said the agreement until now did not appear to have encouraged excessive production of rubber.     In addition, provisions for borrowing to finance the buffer stock have now been eliminated, ruling out speculation. "It is a sort of middle-of-the-road agreement," one delegate said.     The new pact will be open for signature at U.N. Headquarters in New York from May 1 to December 31 this year.     To become operational, it will require ratification by countries accounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct of world imports.     Delegates estimate that this will take 12 to 14 months from now. During the hiatus between the two agreements, the International Natural Rubber Council will remain in place.     The pact will enter into force definitively when governments accounting for 80 pct of world exports and 80 pct of world imports have ratified it.  REUTER ;

"Indonesia, both individually and together with other members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), has protested against the EC plan to increase duties on vegetable oil imports," he told Indonesian reporters.     "We very much regret the community's plan," he added.     He did not say in what form the Indonesian protest was made.     Indonesia is a major palm oil producer.     According to central bank figures, Indonesia exported 362,700 tonnes of crude palm oil to EC countries in calendar 1985 and 301,400 tonnes in the first 10 months of 1986. Complete 1986 figures are not yet available.

TEST;22-MAR-1987 06:42:31.92;SAUDI ARABIA'S KING FAHD VISITS BRITAIN THIS WEEK;     By Deborah Telford, Reuters King Fahd of Saudi Arabia begins a four-day state visit on Tuesday which will focus on redressing Britain's large trade surplus with the kingdom and reaffirming ties between the traditionally close countries.     British officials said King Fahd may ask Britain to restore diplomatic relations with Syria, broken off by London last October after evidence in the trial of Nizar Hindawi showed Syrian agents were behind a plan to bomb an Israeli airliner.     But one official said the king would be told Britain still needs "clear and sustainable evidence that the Syrians have renounced state-sponsored terrorism. So far they haven't."     Britain will stress its support for an international peace conference on the Middle East and its concern over alleged human rights abuses by Israel in the occupied West Bank and Gaza, the officials told Reuters.     The Saudi leader will hold talks with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and meet Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip during the visit, his first to Britain since he assumed power in June 1982.     King Fahd will be accompanied by his trade, defence, oil and health ministers, who will hold talks with their British counterparts.     Relations between the two countries have generally been warm. But they were strained last year by the deportation of 35 British nurses from the kingdom for illegal drinking and the publication of a letter by a retired British ambassador describing Saudi Arabians as incompetent and arrogant.     Saudi Arabia is Britain's largest export market in the Middle East.     Britain exported 1.5 billion stg worth of goods to Saudi Arabia last year while British imports from that country in the same period totalled 436 mln.     Trade officials will discuss what countertrade Britain can offer in return for Riyadh giving London its biggest-ever arms export order.     Under the five billion stg deal signed last year, Saudi Arabia has agreed to buy 132 warplanes including 72 Tornado fighters.     Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer is likely to discuss oil price stabilisation but Britain would not change its refusal to limit its North Sea oil production and exports, officials said.     Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, has asked all oil-producing countries to help stabilise oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel by curbing output and exports.

TEST;22-MAR-1987 20:01:10.69;SWISS BANKERS PLANNING COMPROMISE ON SECRECY CURBS;     By Peter Conradi, Reuters Bankers, concerned about official calls for curbs on Switzerland's banking secrecy, are likely to propose a compromise plan when they meet regulators today, the Bankers Federation Secretary said.     Andreas Hubschmid confirmed a report in yesterday's Sonntagsblick the Federation would make proposals to curb the anonymity given to some bank clients who hide their identities behind lawyers or fiduciary agents.     "The Sonntagsblick story goes in the right direction, and I cannot deny it," Hubschmid told Reuters.     Hubschmid declined to confirm details, saying nothing had yet been decided.     Recent allegations U.S. Officials involved in the arms-for-Iran scandal took advantage of Swiss discretion to open accounts here have added fuel to the long-running secrecy debate, while Manila has said former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos put a fortune into banks here.     While Swiss banks are strictly forbidden to reveal the names of their clients to the outside world, a self-governing code of conduct dating from 1977 requires the bankers themselves know the identities of their clients.     But the banking code, due for renewal this October, allows a client to hide his name behind a lawyer provided the latter signs the so-called "B-form" guaranteeing that his client is not misusing his anonymity for criminal purposes.     The Commission said at the end of last year it wanted use of the form drastically reduced.     The bankers' compromise plan, Sonntagsblick said, quoting reliable sources, aims to eliminate abuses by differentiating between lawyers who just manage portfolios for their clients and those who do so only as a small part of a wider legal service.     Only in the second case, would the use of the B-form still be allowed, it said. Other clients would have to give up their anonymity and reveal their identities to the bank.     Commission President Hermann Bodenmann said the Commission was likely to discuss the proposal at today's meeting with the bankers, and during its own council session on Tuesday. He declined further comment.  The banks draw up their own rules of conduct. But banking analysts said the banks cannot afford to ignore the views of the Commission, which is ultimately responsible for preventing abuses.  REUTER ;
TEST;22-MAR-1987 23:33:16.42;BRAZIL BUSINESS LEADERS CALL FOR TALKS WITH IMF;     By Stephen Powell, Reuters Brazilian business leaders attending a weekend meeting with President Jose Sarney called on the government to seek help from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in resolving its debt problems.     The government has so far rejected suggestions that it let the IMF play a role in rescheduling its 109 billion dlr debt, the biggest in the Third World.     Finance Minister Dilson Funaro has said an IMF program for Brazil, adopted four years ago, caused a recession and he believes another IMF program would stifle growth.     Sarney last month suspended interest payments on Brazil's 68 billion dlr commercial debt, a move which has found little favour among the country's business community.     Several businessmen called for a return to the IMF, arguing this would give the country access to new funds and allow the economy to grow. Both sides in the IMF debate say the course they favour will enable Brazil to avoid recession.     "We have to discuss the foreign debt like Mexico does, if necessary going to the IMF," Mario Amato, president of the Sao Paulo State Industries' Federation, was quoted as saying.      An about-turn on the IMF issue would be politically very difficult for the Sarney government and there are no firm indications such a policy reversal is in the offing.     The person most closely associated with the anti-IMF stance is Finance Minister Dilson Funaro, who was not present at yesterday's meeting. Brazilian newspapers highlighted his absence and reported that several of the 24 businessmen present seized the opportunity to tell Sarney they would like to see Funaro leave his job.  REUTER ;

TEST;23-MAR-1987 02:54:36.15;AUSTRALIAN OIL TAX CUT SEEN BOOSTING OUTPUT;  A 10 percentage point reduction in the Australian government's maximum crude oil levy on old oil would stabilize Bass Straits oil output, resources analyst Ian Story said here.     A reduction to 70 pct from 80 pct would enable Bass Strait output to be maintained at the current rate of 420,000 barrels per day (BPD) for the next year rather than falling to 380,000 BPD in 1987/88, he told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association annual conference.     Story is an analyst with and a director of Sydney stockbroker Meares and Philips Ltd.     Windfall profits taxes on Bass Strait crude are no longer appropriate in the current economic climate, Story said.     The maximum 80 pct levy on old oil -- that discovered before September 1975 -- is now forcing the Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd <BRKN.S>/Exxon Corp <XON> partnership to shut-in production, accelerating the decline in output and reducing government revenue, he said.     He said the producer return per barrel at a price of 30 Australian dlrs a barrel would rise to 2.07 dlrs from 0.80 dlrs if the levy was cut to 70 pct.     "The economics at an 80 pct levy are simply not attractive at oil prices below 30 dlrs," Story said.     Cutting the maximum levy rate to 70 pct would create higher levels of self-sufficiency, increase government revenue, boost exports and provide incentives for exploration and development, he said.     The government is currently reviewing the oil tax structure.  REUTER ;
TEST;23-MAR-1987 03:01:41.93;GERMAN BOND YIELDS SEEN FALLING IN NEAR TERM ;     By Alice Ratcliffe, Reuters West German bond yields could decline over the next few months if recent efforts to stabilize exchange rates, as seen in last month's Paris pact, extend to keeping down European interest rates, banking economists said.     But in the longer term domestic yields could rise under agreements to stimulate West Germany's economy, they said.     The Paris agreement has so far successfully stabilized currencies with the threat of central bank intervention, economists said.     Economists speculated that G-7 countries may try to bolster the pact by uncoupling U.S. and West German interest rates further when they meet for the IMF Interim Committee in April. "The recent round of monetary accommodation by the Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan and the firming of the Federal Funds rate are significant. They mark an uncoupling of movements in U.S. and foreign interest rates," Salomon Bros Inc said in a recent study.     It said narrowing of international interest rate spreads was a major factor in the dollar's fall. These spreads will have to be widened if the dollar is to be stabilized.     West German Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl encouraged the U.S. not to cut interest rates in January when the Bundesbank cut its own rates by half a point, to avoid weakening the dollar.     West German economists see room for further cuts in leading West German rates if the dollar resumes its decline.     "It's not a taboo," Peter Pietsch, spokesman for Commerzbank AG said.     But most economists see room for a cut in West German rates only in the first half of the year, as re-emerging inflation will limit room for manoeuvre later in the year.     The Bundesbank's average yield of public paper is already nearing last year's low. Last week, yields fell to around 5.50 pct, not far from the 1986 low of 5.35 pct posted in mid-April.  Economists said the trend may cause domestic investors to shift some funds from short to longer-term paper. Such a move would tend to flatten the yield curve between short and long-term rates, which has become more pronounced since the Bundesbank lowered its discount rate.     It might also facilitate a further cut in leading rates, as the shift out of savings accounts into securities would slow growth of the Bundesbank's central bank money stock aggregate.     But conflicting with this trend are plans to increase West German tax cuts, part of the Paris currency pact designed to meet U.S. demands for faster West German growth. This move may force interest rates up by creating a revenue vacuum which must be filled by higher government borrowing.     This may not occur if private sector demand for credit remains weak, but demand could emerge if rates begin rising.     Economists said it appeared the government had already stepped up borrowing this year to accomodate revenue loss from other sources, including tax losses resulting from weaker than expected economic growth, and higher than expected spending.     Josef Koerner, chief economist of the West German Ifo-Institut, said in a newspaper interview he expected 1987 tax revenue to be some 11 billion marks below estimates by the West German government in November.     Any tax shortfall in itself is unlikely to push yields up. But coupled with other factors such as waning foreign speculative buying of mark bonds on the dollar's decline, long term yields may to have to rise, economists said.     Public authority borrowing in 1988 may also rise owing to increases in the second phase of Bonn's tax reform package.     The West German government is raising its total tax cuts in 1988 by 5.2 billion marks to 14.4 billion.     West German chancellor Helmut Kohl said last week increased borrowing to finance the tax reform is acceptable.     Finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said last Thursday he was looking for other ways to finance the reform, such as raising indirect taxes.     But few economists believe the government will be able to go through with its tax measures without increasing net borrowing.     The Bundesbank said in its February report that it was wrong to believe that the first stage of the tax reform in 1986 could be managed without increasing deficits.     The Bundesbank said West German public authorities borrowed a large 21.9 billion marks in credit markets in the 1986 final quarter compared with 14.8 billion in fourth quarter 1985.     The federal government took up nearly 10 billion marks of the fourth quarter 1986 figures, and also drew on two billion marks of Bundesbank advances at the end of the year, when it had not required such a credit in the 1985 quarter.

TEST;23-MAR-1987 05:10:10.05;JAPAN ECONOMY SEEN GROWING 3.6 PCT IN 1987/88;  Japan is expected to post a 3.6 pct rise in real gross national product in 1987/88, higher than the official 3.5 pct target, a private economic institute said.     The Research Institute on National Economy said in a report the economy will start picking up in the April-June quarter, partly because of an improvement in earnings performance and capital spending in manufacturing industries.     The institute assumed an average exchange rate in the year starting April 1 of 150 yen to the dollar. It predicted the Bank of Japan will not change the official discount rate in the year.     The institute forecast that Japan's exports will gradually rise in the year in volume terms as the dollar's fall in the past 18 months is likely to help prop up the U.S. Economy.     Japan's trade surplus is expected to narrow slightly to 90.2 billion dlrs in 1987/88 ending March 31 from an estimated 98 billion in the current fiscal year, it said.  REUTER ;

Treasury director Daniel Lebegue said last month that gross domestic product is expected to grow by between two and 2.5 pct this year, against an original target of 2.8 pct.

Officials at the 6. Juli Bank were not immediately available for comment and calls to the Copenhagen head office were intercepted by an operator who said the office was closed.     The Inspectorate statement said: "Payments have been stopped out of regard for the depositors." This would allow closer investigation with a view to reconstruction and "negotiations on this have started."     The statement said: "The inspectors have inquired into certain financial transactions involving considerable extraordinary income in the submission of the 1986 balance sheet. The inspectors have not found themselves able to approve this book entry.     "The inspectors have further examined the bank's liquidity position and its commitments and have established the need for considerably higher provisions against losses on loans."     The bank is independent and has four branches in the Copenhagen area. Details of previous profits were not immediately available.

TEST;23-MAR-1987 07:14:51.62;DEBT SOLUTION REQUIRES OPEN MARKETS, GERMAN BANKER;  The solution of the world's debt crisis requires open markets but a possible resurgence of protectionism is the biggest danger, the president of the Federal Association of German Banks, Wolfgang Roeller, said.     Roeller, who is also management board spokesman of Dresdner Bank AG, said in a radio interview it is unlikely Brazil's suspension last month of part of its interest payments would lead to a chain reaction in Latin America.     It is important to increase the efficiency of debtor countries to such an extent they earn sufficient currency from exports to repay foreign debt, he said.     Brazil had taken a unilateral step, Roeller said, but Brazil had a strong and broad economic base. With the help of appropriate economic programmes there should be a way to bring back financial stability to that country.     Roeller said action on the debt situation had to be taken now. It could not be expected debtor countries would be able to repay debts in the short run, even if economic conditions improved. Programmes had to be developed which would strengthen the economic position of these countries, to ensure world economic growth so they are able to sell their products at adequate prices.     Roeller said the debt crisis could only be solved in coordination with governments, international organisations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and creditor banks.     "This is not a topic which can be solved by creditor banks alone," he said. One aim had to be to raise the credit standing of debtor countries to such a degree they are able to raise funds on international credit markets again. He said a whole set of new ideas had been developed and he was convinced the international banking system would provide more funds, but the problem is not just economic but also political.  REUTER ;
TEST;23-MAR-1987 07:50:06.42;NEXT WORLD TRADE NEGOTIATIONS MUST SUCCEED - NZ;     By Christopher Pritchett, Reuters Ministers from more than 20 nations were told by New Zealand that the next international negotiations on liberalising trade would be the last this century and the cost of failure could not be measured.     Trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues at a welcoming ceremony before two days of talks here that great progress had been made in preparing for the negotiations which must not be sidetracked.     "We live in troubled and dangerous times for the world trading system," he said.     "We have seen that the failure of the world trading system has caused great depression and conflict in the past. Our failure to maintain the momentum will be at great cost to us all," Moore said.    "The cost of failure is beyond calculation. It is our last hope and best opportunity this century. We will not get another chance before the year 2000," he added.     The ministers are in New Zealand to review world trade since the "Uruguay round" talks last September. The talks are  also part of preparations for a full-scale June meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Venice.     The Uruguay meeting is considered by most countries to have been particularly successful, with northern hemisphere countries managing to have service industries such as banking and insurance included in the next full round.     The southerners' goal of including agricultural and tropical products also was met.     The meeting at this North Island tourist resort is described by participants as informal and no declaration is expected.     Moore said one aim was to "instil a sense of political urgency to avert potential economic tragedy."     Another was to seek ways of popularising freer trade to people who felt the pain of readjustment but could not see the benefits, as well as preventing "bush fires of confrontation while we proceed with orderly negotiations."     The meeting is being attended by 25 overseas delegations including representatives of GATT and the Economic Community.     The delegates include U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.     American sources say he is ready to state that the best way to reverse protectionist sentiment in the United States is to implement four key Uruguay proposals:     -- an end to agricultural subsidies      -- inclusion of trade in services and investments in GATT regulations      -- tightening of restrictions on pirating of so-called intellectual property such as trademarks, patents and copyrights      -- new rules to resolve trade disputes among GATT's 92 member states.

TEST;23-MAR-1987 10:16:17.72;IADB PLANS TO MATCH 1986 LENDING LEVEL;  The Inter-American Development Bank said it intended this year to match the over three billion dlrs it lent to Latin America in 1986, despite growing pressures on its capital.     In its annual report and in a briefing for reporters, the Bank made it clear, however, that the Latin countries needed vast amounts of new investment if they are to strengthen their ailing economies in the period ahead. The report said Latin America continued to emerge slowly from the deep recession that began in the early 1980s, with Gross Domestic Product edging up to nearly four pct from 3.5 pct in 1985.     The report said the region's improved economic growth last year was based on a rise in internal demand and fuller utilization previously underused production capacity.     "This situation will be difficult to duplicate in 1987 and beyond because no significant new investments are being made," the report said.     The Bank's lending last year consisted of 63 loans totaling 3.04 billion dlrs, bringing the agency's cumulative lending to 35.44 billion dlrs.     Of last year's loans, 2.26 billion dlrs was actually disbursed, bringing total disbursements to 24.03 billion dlrs.     To assist in loan activities, the Bank said it borrowed 1.91 billion dlrs in the capital markets in 1986, bringing its total outstanding borrowings to 12.11 billion dlrs.     In a briefing for reporters, Bank President Antonio Ortiz-Mena said that this year lending by the bank "will be at a similar level to last year."     He noted that bank lending in 1986 was directed particularly to projects in energy, agriculture, and environmental and public health, education and urban development. The annual report was released as the Bank's annual meeting is being held in Miami.     Ortiz-Mena told reporters that the bank's member countries will discuss a plan by the United States to reduce the loan veto power from the current majority to 35 pct.     Such a plan would allow the United States to block any loan it did not like with the assistance of only one other country.     The proposal, which is tied to any U.S. backing for a new financing for the bank, is sure to run into rough going as the Latin countries view it as a move by the Reagan administration to control the agency's critical loans.     The U.S. position is that it is not seeking veto power although it believes the bank's largest contributors should have greater influence within the institution.      Reuter ;

The changes reflect the restruction of Beneficial which include the sale of subsidiaries Western National Life, American Centennial Insurance Co and Beneficial National Bank USA.

TEST;23-MAR-1987 13:57:16.98;U.S. PREPARED TO ESCORT KUWAITI TANKERS;     By CHARLES ALDINGER, Reuters The United States has offered Navy warships to escort Kuwaiti oil tankers into and out of the  Gulf where they could be threatened by new Iranian anti-ship missiles, U.S. defense officials said today.     "We believe the Kuwaitis have also approached the Soviet Union about the possibility of using Soviet tankers" to ship their oil, one of the officials told Reuters. "But if there is superpower protection, we would rather it come from us," the official said.     The officials, who asked not to be identified, said Kuwait had asked about possible protection for a dozen vessels, most of them oil tankers, which could be supplied by three U.S. Navy guided missile destroyers and two guided missile frigates now in the southern part of the Gulf.     "We told them we would give them help and we are waiting to hear the Kuwaiti response to our offer," one official said.     In addition to a half dozen ships in the U.S. Navy's small Mideast Task Force near the Straits of Hormuz, the Pentagon has moved 18 warships -- including the Aircraft Carrier Kitty Hawk -- into the northern Indian Ocean in the past month.     White House and defense officials said today that massing of the fleet was routine and had nothing to do with the Iran-Iraq war or Iran's recent stationing of Chinese-made  anti-ship missiles near the mouth of the Gulf.     The land-based missiles have increased concern in Kuwait and other Middle East countries that their oil shipments might be affected. Several hundred vessels have been confirmed hit in the  Gulf by Iran and Iraq since early 1984. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters today that it was in the U.S. strategic interest to keep the free flow of oil in the gulf and through the Straits of Hormuz.     But he said U.S. ships in the region were on routine maneuvers.     Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger on Sunday declined to discuss specifics, but said the United States would do whatever was necessary to keep the Gulf shipping open in the face of new Iranian anti-ship missiles in the region.     "We are fully prepared to do what's necessary to keep the shipping going and keep the freedom of navigation available in that very vital waterway of the world," he said on NBC television's "Meet the Press."     The State Department said Friday Iran has been informed about U.S. concern over the threat to oil shipments in the Gulf. The communciation was sent through Switzerland, which represents American interests in Iran.      Iran on Sunday denied as baseless reports that it intended to threaten shipping in the gulf and warned the United States that any interference in the region would meet a strong response from Tehran, Tehran Radio said.     An Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, quoted in a broadcast monitored by the BBC in London, said reports that Iran intends to threaten shipping in the Gulf were baseless.     "In conjunction with this misleading propaganda, America has already paved the ground to achieve its expansionist and hegemonistic intentions, aiming to build up its military presence in the region," he was quoted as saying.

Sosnoff also said he has held preliminary talks with Pratt Hotel Corp <PRAT> and Southmark Corp <SM> on forming a joint venture to enter into talks to acquire Caesars in a friendly transaction in which Sosnoff would have a 50 pct interest and Pratt and Southmark the remainder.     Sosnoff said the talks with Pratt and Southmark are not being actively pursued at the presentand may or may not be continued in the future.  He said there could be no assurance that a joint venture would be formed or that Caesars would agreed to talks.  "Several preliminary contacts with representatives of Caesars have not resulted in any indication that it wishes to enter into such negotiations," Sosnoff said.     He said based on talks with staff members of gaming authorities, there can be no assurance that the necessary regulatory review of its bid for Caesars World can be completed by the original April Three expiration date.     Sosnoff said it has extended the tender until May 15.  The bid remains subject to regulatory approvals and the arrangement of financing.     Pratt, which owns the Sands Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, N.J., where Caesars operates the Boardwalk Regency Hotel and Casino, recently waged an apparently unsuccessful campaign to acquire control of Resorts International Inc <RTA> against New York developer Donald Trump.  Southmark owns about 37 pct of Pratt Hotel.

TEST;23-MAR-1987 14:30:22.14;TALKING POINT/WENDY'S INTERNATIONAL <WEN>;     By Patti Domm, Reuters Takeover speculation buoyed Wendy's International Inc's stock, even after Coca Cola Co took the fizz out of market rumors by denying it was an interested suitor.     Wendy's retreated from an earlier high of 13-3/8, and lost a point when Coca Cola <KO> said the rumors were untrue. However, Wendy's remained up 5/8 at 12-3/8 on volume of more than three mln shares.     Several analysts were skeptical of the rumors, yet they said they could not conclude a takeover of the fast food restaurant chain was impossible.     Wendy's declined comment on takeover rumors of all kinds. Yet, a Wendy's spokesman said the company was aware of a Business Week article, which named Coke as a potential suitor and which market sources said helped ignite the rumor mill.     Market sources mentioned Anheuser-Busch Inc <BUD> and Pepsico Inc <PEP> as alternatives to Coke as acquirers. Neither of those companies would comment, nor would the Wendy's official.     "It doesn't happen every day, every week, every month, but its not unusual for us to be linked with those companies," said Denny Lynch, Wendy's vice president of communications.     However, Lynch would not comment specifically on the current market rumors.     Even before Coke denied the rumors, analysts had been skeptical of a takeover since Atlanta-based Coke has stated it views fast food chains as customers and does not want to become a competitor to them.     "I can't put another name on it," said Kidder peabody analyst Jay Freedman as vaguer rumors continued to hold up Wendy's stock. "It very well could be someone's interested."     But Freedman said he doesn't believe now is the right time for Wendy's to be sold.     "They're obviously having operational difficulties. I've always believed at the right price Wendy's would consider (an offer), but I can't believe this is the right price at the right time," Freedman said.     "If a transaction takes place, the buyer's going to control the situation," Freedman said.     "I just don't think there's anything going on. I don't think it's worth much more than where it is," said Joseph Doyle of Smith Barney.     Analysts said Wendy's has suffered largely from the "burger wars" between itself, McDonald's Corp <MCD> and Pillsbury Co's <PSY> Burger King chain. Wendy's, the third largest fast food hamburger chain in the U.S., lost about 11 pct in same store sales last year, analysts said.     Wendy's also fumbled when it introduced a high-priced breakfast, which it has since withdrawn, analysts said. Some analysts said the company should be bringing in new products, but it is too soon to predict a significant turnaround.     There are analysts, however, who believe Wendy's may be vulnerable to a takeover.     James Murren of C.J. Lawrence said Wendy's could be worth 14 to 15 dlrs on a break-up basis. He said the company has improved its debt-to-equity ratio and Wendy's owns a high percent of its own restaurants - 38 pct of 3,500.     "They also have some attractive leaseholds on their restaurants," Murren said.     Murren said that despite the downturn in sales last year, Wendy's real sales, store for store, turned upwards in the fourth quarter. "That was about the first time in seven quarters," he said.     Caroline Levy of E.F. Hutton also believes something could be going on with Wendy's. "My gut feeling is something's going to happen. I don't know what," she said.     She estimated a takeover price would be at least 15 dlrs per share.     One analyst speculated that Coke became the rumored suitor because Wendy's decided to sell Coke at its fountains instead of Pepsi.     Wendy's is currently embroiled in litigation brought by Pepsi, which holds a contract with the company, analysts said. Pepsi's soda is still sold in the Wendy's restaurants.  Reuter ;

TEST;23-MAR-1987 16:17:13.90;IBM <IBM> REBOUND SEEN BY BERNSTEIN ANALYST;  International Business Machines Corp, hit by a two-year earnings slump, should begin a come-back by the end of 1987 and post strong growth in 1988, analyst Rick Martin of Sanford C. Bernstein Co Inc said.     "There will be increasing momentum in earnings, albeit not until later this year," Martin said at a technology conference sponsored by the investment firm.     Martin said the coming rebound reflects new product introductions in the mid-range area, rather than any drastic improvement in economic growth or U.S. capital spending.     IBM, whose stock hit a 52-week low of 115-3/4 dlrs in mid-January, has come back lately. IBM was trading up 7/8 at 149-1/2 dlrs.     Analysts, computer industry executives, and the company itself, have highlighted the external economic factors hampering IBM's growth.     But Martin said the product cycle was key to understanding the rise and fall of IBM and other computer companies, and pointed to Digital Equipment Corp <DEC> to support his view. "By replacing the product line, earnings have soared," he said of DEC's line of VAX computers.     In contrast to DEC, IBM faultered with an incompatible mid-range product line. A new computer code-named "Fort Knox" was supposed to tie together a number of IBM's mid-range systems, but the product never got off the ground, he said.     Instead, aspects of the computer were integrated into the IBM 9370 machine introduced last year, and other aspects should be unwrapped by 1988, Martin said. "The major story will be a rebound in its mid-range business."     He said sales of IBM's mid-range computers fell about 13 pct in 1986. But the new products will lead to 5.8 pct growth in mid-range computers this year and 30.7 pct growth in 1988.     High-end computers, primarily the Sierra line, are coming to the end of their product life cycle. Although growing 22.5 pct in the midst of IBM's sharply lower 1986 year, growth will drop to 1.5 pct in 1987 and 1.9 pct in 1988, he said.     By 1988, overall revenue growth should rise to about 16 pct, against 5.8 pct growth in 1987 and 2.4 pct in 1986, Martin said. Last year, IBM earned 4.8 billion dlrs on revenues of 51.3 billion dlrs.     Investors asked what this all meant to DEC, whose earnings and stock have been propelled by a strong slew of product introductions in the mid-range area.     In response, Martin said he did not view IBM as a threat to DEC, nor DEC as a threat to IBM, because both companies were catering largely to existing customer bases, rather than stealing market share from one another.

The surprise escalation of attacks on oil installations broke more than a month-long lull in Iraqi air force action.     It also followed celebrations yesterday of what Baghdad hailed as Iran's failure to achieve victory during the Iranian year which ended on Saturday.     A high command communique said warplanes hit the western jetty at Iran's Kharg island oil terminal in the afternoon and struck a supertanker nearby at the same time.     The Kharg terminal, attacked about 135 times since August 1985, was last raided in January.     The communique did not identify the supertanker, but said columns of smoke were seen billowing from it.     In London, Lloyds insurance said the 162,046-ton Iranian tanker Avaj was hit on Saturday, when Iraq reported an earlier Gulf attack.     But there has been no independent confirmation of today's supertanker attack nor of other raids on shipping reported by Baghdad in the past 24 hours.     The last confirmed Iraqi attack took place on March 8, when the Iranian tanker Khark-5 was hit south of Kharg.     Iraqi warplanes also struck Iran's offshore oilfields at Nowruz, Cyrus and Ardeshir in northern gulf, some 80 km (50 miles) west of Kharg island, today's communique said.  Reuter ;

Mulroney told delegates to a North American wildlife conference that he has not been pleased with the U.S. administration's lack of speed in acting on the question, which Canada sees, he said, "as a test of our relationship" with the U.S.     Mulroney and President Reagan endorsed a report by specially appointed acid rain envoys last year. Last week, the White  House asked Congress for 2.50 billion U.S. dlrs to fund the acid rain fight.     Mulroney described the commitment as "significant," but noted it was a long time in coming.     "We are geared up, tanked up and raring to go," Mulroney said. "But I must tell you we were not happy with the pace with which the U.S. administration moved to implement the president's acceptance of the envoy report."     The prime minister urged his mostly American audience to help Canada take the fight to Congress, saying his government is determined to fight on more than one front.     "The campaign does not involve either or choices between the administration on one hand and Capitol Hill on the other," he said.

TEST;24-MAR-1987 01:42:03.41;GATT ROUND MAY STOP GROWING TRADE PROBLEMS - U.S.;  A successful new GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) round is needed to halt growing bilateral trade problems between major trading partners, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said.     Yeutter, in New Zealand for informal GATT ministerial talks, told Reuters bilateral trade disputes are increasing because the multilateral system is inefficient.     "That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATT round," he said. "The very existence of all these bilateral irritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateral solutions to some of these problems."     The eighth GATT round of negotiations was launched at Punta del Este in Uruguay in September 1986. Agriculture and services were included in the negotiations for the first time.     The growing debt burden of Latin American and African nations will also provide impetus for the GATT round to succeed, he said.     "Clearly those countries need to develop their export endeavours and they need open markets for that to happen and that's the basic objective of the new GATT round," he said.     But he said the GATT round is a long term endeavour. It will not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries, but it will make a difference in 10 to 15 years.     "It's a worthwhile activity from their standpoint because these debts are not going to go away in the next year or two," he said.

TEST;24-MAR-1987 01:46:56.92;SHELL AUSTRALIA REPORTS 45.79 MLN DLR 1986 PROFIT;  Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD.AMS> unit <Shell Australia Ltd>, said its net profit fell to 45.79 mln dlrs in 1986 from 66.76 mln in 1985.     Revenue fell to 4.55 billion dlrs from 4.91 billion, in an extremely competitive and over-regulated environment, chairman and chief executive Kevan Gosper said in a statement. A 26.25 mln dlr annual dividend would be paid to the parent after a very disappointing year.     "A return of 2.2 pct on funds employed represents a very meagre return ... In an economy suffering from inflation of around 10 pct," he said.     Gosper said the results reflected heavy reliance on downstream oil and chemicals, poor coal and metal returns and the financial burden of the North-West Shelf gas project.     Duties, royalties and taxes rose to 1.37 billion dlrs against 852.72 mln in 1985 and Gosper urged the government to move quickly to lift costly and unnecessary regulation.     "It is just as important for Australia to maintain a financially healthy, technically advanced refining and marketing industry as it is to sustain oil exploration and production," he said.     "The Australian oil industry has the experience and the capacity to serve the nation and its shareholders well if the government would stop putting roadblocks in our way," he said.     Shell invested 500 mln dlrs over the past five years to upgrade its oil refining and marketing business, but further investment required an appropriate rate of return, he said.     Exploration and evaluation spending in 1986 fell to 18.77 mln dlrs from 26.35 mln, while investment in property and plant rose to 374.25 mln from 353.94 mln a year earlier.     Gosper said oil companies would be under intense pressure in 1987 because of forecast slow economic growth.  REUTER ;
TEST;24-MAR-1987 03:16:30.93;WORLD BANK CHIEF PLEDGES SUPPORT TO INDONESIA;  World Bank president Barber Conable pledged the Bank's support to help Indonesia adjust to lower world oil prices, but said further deregulation of its protected economy was needed.     Speaking to reporters after talks with President Suharto, he said he expected Jakarta to do more to liberalise the economy and deregulate trade policy.     Indonesia, hurt by the fall in oil prices last year which cut the value of its crude exports in half, is the Third World's sixth largest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrs from the World Bank in the past 20 years.     Conable said the World Bank, which granted Indonesia a 300 mln dlr loan last month to help its balance of payments, was prepared to back Jakarta in taking the right steps to adjust to lower oil and primary commodity prices.     "We are prepared to support those steps which we believe are consistent with the development of the Indonesian economy," he said.     He said Jakarta's willingness to move quickly after last year's collapse in oil price saved Indonesia from some of the difficulties now faced by other countries.     Indonesia devalued its currency by 31 pct against the dollar in September to avoid a balance of payments crisis, and has announced a series of measures since May intended to stimulate exports, encourage foreign investment and revitalise the economy.     However, key monopolies in areas like steel and plastics and high tariff barriers remain in place.     Conable arrived in Indonesia on Saturday and has since met 14 Indonesian cabinet ministers to review the country's borrowing needs and the impact of falling oil prices on the country.  REUTER ;

TEST;24-MAR-1987 04:50:32.06;CHINA EXPECTED TO SHOW BIG 1986 BUDGET DEFICIT;     By Mark O'Neill, Reuters China's Finance Minister Wang Bingqian will report a 1986 budget deficit of up to nine billion yuan and prescribe austerity measures for 1987 in a budget speech on Thursday, foreign bankers and diplomats told Reuters.     Chinese officials have said the 1986 deficit is "several billion," after a surplus of 2.82 billion in 1985 which followed six years of deficits, including a record 17 billion yuan shortfall in 1979. They have not given an exact figure.     The officials blamed the deficit on excessive investment in fixed assets and consumer demand, a drop in efficiency in state firms, a trade deficit and lower income from import duties.     "China needs a nationwide campaign to increase production while cutting expenditure," the official Peking Review said in an editorial yesterday.     "China should institute means for the effective control of the macro-economy and the invigoration of enterprises, larger ones in particular, by emphasising quality, efficiency and reduced consumption," it said.     Only by such measures, the magazine said, "can an overall supply-demand balance in society be secured and the economy develop steadily over a long period."     A Western diplomat said major factors for the deficit, which he estimated at up to nine billion yuan, were a drop in efficiency and wage rises in state firms, whose profits and taxes account for a substantial part of national revenue.     The State Statistical Bureau (SSB) last month said profits and taxes of state firms in 1986 fell 0.2 pct from 1985 to 119.3 billion yuan, while production costs were over budget, losses rose and product quality was unstable.     The SSB said profits in most state firms fell because of bad management and rapid changes in external conditions.     "For some materials, state firms have to compete on the free market, where prices are up to double those for materials they buy under fixed quota from the state," the diplomat said.     "The firms are not subject to proper market discipline, because they cannot go bankrupt, do not have to repay bank loans and have to employ workers whether or not they need them. Under these conditions, they cannot properly adjust to the economic levers the state is introducing," he said.     Another diplomat said Wang's major problem is excess demand in the economy, caused by wage increases well ahead of industrial growth, and excess growth in capital construction.     "He must dampen this growth through raising taxes or cutting government expenditure," he said. "China's economy is inherently unstable, either in a high or a trough."     He said Wang will reaffirm themes repeated by leaders since the start of the year -- thrift, improved efficiency, cutting investment outside the state plan and reducing consumption to bring demand and supply into balance.     "There will be no surprises," the diplomat said.     The first diplomat said one sign of the thrifty times was the lack of a banquet during a visit he made to a major Chinese industrial city.     "Normally, a foreign guest's visit is a chance for the boys to feast on Mao Tai (a strong liquor), turtle and sea slugs, with one banquet given by them and one given in return by me. But there was none on this visit," he said.     He added economic reforms will slow this year, in particular price changes and the issuing of shares, which raise sensitive issues about ownership and ideology. Bond issues raise no such dilemmas and will continue, he added.     A North American banker, who estimated the deficit at about eight billion yuan, said economic policy has been affected by a national drive against "bourgeois liberalism," a phrase meaning Western political ideas.     "In China the political system dictates economic policy," he said. "The large deficit gives the conservatives a stick to beat the reformers and demand more economic austerity.     "One of China's top economic policy makers told me this week 1987 will be a year of consolidation for his firm, with less overseas investment, lower imports and new funding to be sourced internally."     The banker said he is more comfortable about China's stability now than two months ago, when the drive was launched after the resignation of Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang.     "There is no leftist alternative to the reforms," he said. "There is no going back to the policy of strict central control. But the reforms will take years. What you have now is a confused mix of control and market economies."  REUTER ;

TEST;24-MAR-1987 07:21:18.55;PHILIPPINES SAID TO RAISE INTEREST OFFER TO BANKS;  Prospects of an agreement on rescheduling about 9.4 billion dlrs of Philippine foreign debt have increased following the offer of a higher interest rate by Manila officials, foreign banking sources said.     The sources said Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin made the proposal to a 12-bank advisory committee, chaired by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co as the talks entered their fourth week in New York.     They said the Philippines was now willing to pay a spread of 7/8 percentage points over London Interbank Offered Rates (Libor), up from the 5/8 points it originally proposed.     The sources said the proposal was made in a bid to break a deadlock with the banks, who were insisting on a minimum interest spread of one full percentage point over Libor.     They noted that the latest plan marked a compromise between the two sides' demands, but fell short of Ongpin's assertion that the Philippines would insist on a deal better than the 13/16 percentage points offered to Mexico last year by its creditor banks.     The sources added that two key members of the negotiating team returned to Manila last night, indicating agreement was likely to be hammered out by this weekend.     The sources said Finance Undersecretary Ernest Leung and Deputy Central Bank Governor Edgardo Zialcita left New York after Ongpin and Central Bank Governor Jose Fernandez started talks with the banks to put finishing touches to the accord.     "The talks are now in a make-or-break phase," the sources said. "All that is left are the wrinkles -- unless some bank again decides to hang tough."     They were referring to the last round of negotiations in November 1986, when one bank, identified as Citibank NA, refused to endorse the committee's proposal of 1-1/8 points over Libor.  REUTER... ;
TEST;24-MAR-1987 07:29:11.71;BUNDESBANK ALLOCATES 6.5 BILLION MARKS IN TENDER;  The Bundesbank accepted bids for 6.5 billion marks at today's tender for a 28-day securities repurchase pact at a rate of 3.80 pct, a central bank spokesman said.     Banks, which bid for a total 8.6 billion marks liquidity, will be credited with the funds allocated tomorrow and must buy back securities pledged on April 22.     The allocation was in line with market expectations the Bundesbank would provide more than the 3.4 billion marks draining from this week as an earlier facility expires.     Call money fell to 3.60/70 pct ahead of the allocation from 3.75/85 pct yesterday, dealers said.     The excess allocation compensates for public funds leaving the system which the Bundesbank added last week via government-owned banks.     However major tax payments by banks on behalf of customers drew to a close this week, lessening the need for liquidity.     The call money declines surprised some dealers, who speculated it was because the Bundesbank disbursed further government funds today. However, most said this had not occurred.     Banks were well stocked with liquidity, having 47.1 billion marks in minimum reserves at the Bundesbank on Friday, up from 49.9 billion on Thursday. Average daily reserves over the first 20 days of the month fell to 52.6 billion from 53.1 billion. For all of March, banks would be required to hold net daily average reserves of 50.7 billion marks, dealers said.  REUTER ;

A British Army spokeswoman said today that seven people were still being treated for minor injuries in hospitals in the Moenchengladbach area, near the Rheindahlen base, after being being hit by flying shards of glass from the blast.     The 100-kg bomb went off outside an officers' mess at 10.30 P.M. (2130 GMT), ripping a crater half a meter (1.5 feet) deep and three meters (nine feet) wide in the ground, and could be heard several kilometers (miles) away, a police spokesman said.     An anonymous caller, speaking English, telephoned the West German domestic news agency Deutsche Presse Agentur just before the explosion and said a bomb was about to go off at the base.     Thatcher left Bonn early yesterday evening after talks with with Chancellor Helmut Kohl ahead of her visit to Moscow next week. She had flown to West Germany from talks with French President Francois Mitterrand in Normandy earlier in the day.

The B and Q Do it Yourself centres raised sales by 31 pct and retail profit by 37 pct, with its pretax contribution of 45.5 mln making it the largest single component.

In other sectors, the Comet electrical chain raised retail profits by 46 pct to 17.4 mln stg, while the Woolworth chain reported a 120 pct improvement to 38.7 mln.     The company said its property operations would increase substantially following the start of a joint venture deal with developers <Rosehaugh Plc>.

TEST;24-MAR-1987 10:00:16.07;U.S. ECONOMY SHOWS PROMISING SIGNS OF GROWTH;     By Donna Smith, Reuters The U.S. economy is showing some promising signs of accelerated expansion despite the sluggishness of the fourth quarter last year, private economists say.     Some of the slowness experienced in the October-December period had been expected to spill over into the first quarter this year, as the tax law changes that went into effect in January slowed business and consumer spending.     But some of the latest economic data show signs of surprising strength in the U.S. economy, although some economists remain cautious about the outlook.     The Commerce Department reported today that new orders for durable goods in February jumped by 5.7 billion dlrs, a six pct rise, to 101.2 billion dlrs. Even excluding volatile defense goods, durable goods orders rose a healthy 3.8 pct, the agency said.     The February numbers surpassed the expectations of many financial analysts, whose predictions ranged from flat to increases of up to five pct.     The January/February employment statistics suggest the Gross National Product will show a healthy rate of growth for the first three months of this year, said Lyle Gramley, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association.     The U.S. jobless rate in February and January was 6.7 pct, the lowest rate since March 1980. The number of new non-farm jobs rose by 337,000 in February after a 319,000 gain in January and a 225,000 December increase, the government said.     The employment data suggests a GNP annual growth rate of about three to 3.25 pct in the first quarter, said Gramley.     Much of that will be attributed to businesses rebuilding their inventories and is not likely to be sustained in the second quarter, Gramley said. He expects a slowdown in the second quarter with smaller increases in personal consumption and government spending. He also sees residential construction declining mostly for multi-family housing units.     Fidelity Bank senior economist Mickey Levy said some of the fourth quarter slowness will continue.     Levy predicts GNP will grow at a scant 1.5 pct rate in the first quarter of 1987, accelerate during the second quarter and show a brisk 4.5 pct annual rate in the third quarter.     The key to both forecasts is a marked improvement in the U.S. trade balance which is expected because of the decline in the dollar's value over the last year and half.     "The improvement will be gradual and long lasting," Levy predicted. Most of it will be through import reduction, but at least one-third will be due to a rise in product exports as the prices of U.S. goods become more attractive overseas.     The Reagan administration has predicted the trade deficit, which soared to record levels last year, will improve this year and the U.S. economy will grow by a respectable 3.2 pct for the year compared with a 2.5 pct rate last year.     As part of the effort to reduce the trade deficit, the U.S. has been pressing West Germany and Japan to stimulate their domestic demand for goods from the U.S. and others.     U.S. officials believe that would help take some of the pressure off the United States whose five years of economic growth has been the mainstay of developing countries.     The U.S. economy provided them with a giant market for their goods giving them a way to earn income badly needed to service their foreign debt.     The government last week said the U.S. economy grew at a modest 1.1 pct annual rate during the fourth quarter.     There were indications of improvement in the huge imbalance between the volume of goods imported to the United States and those shipped abroad. The report showed a rising volume of exports corresponding to a decline in imports despite the fact that in current dollar terms, the U.S. trade deficit worsened during the closing three months of 1986.     While fourth quarter economic growth was weak, corporate profits jumped a healthy 6.1 pct during the period, the government said. It also reported that inflation, as measured by the GNP price deflator, remained in check, growing a moderate 0.7 pct in the period, the lowest rise in 19 years.     The government also reported that consumer spending, a key element of the five year economic recovery, jumped 1.7 pct in February, after falling two pct in January.     The Federal Reserve Board also reported that the manufacturing sector, which had been one of the weaker elements of the U.S. economy, was showing signs of recovery.     In its latest report on current economic conditions, the Fed said that economic activity in the various regions of the country ranged from uneven or steady to improving. Manufacturing activity showed signs of improvement in most regions except Dallas where orders remained sluggish.     Chase Econometrics Chairman Lawrence Chimerine said the pick up in the U.S. manufacturing sector is largely due to the drop in the dollar's value. He said he does not foresee a major pick up in economic activity, but does not believe the economy will slip into recession either.     He said higher prices on imported products and wage cuts that have helped the manufacturing sector will squeeze consumers purchasing power.

TEST;24-MAR-1987 10:42:01.79;PHILIPPINE CENTRAL BANKER FACES CORRUPTION CHARGES;     By Chaitanya Kalbag, Reuters A government-appointed special prosecutor has ordered the filing of corruption charges over the closure of a private bank against Philippine central bank governor Jose Fernandez, who said he would contest the charges.     Ombudsman Raul Gonzalez told Reuters there was evidence to indicate that Fernandez had misused his office in ordering the closure of <Pacific Banking Corp> in July, 1985.     He said the charges against Fernandez would be filed "within the week" in a special court for corruption cases, adding that a defendant could appeal against a ruling in the Supreme Court.     Fernandez is in New York for talks with the Philippines' creditor banks on rescheduling about 9.4 billion dlrs of the country's foreign debt.     A central bank statement quoted Fernandez as saying Pacific Bank's closure and sale were in accordance with law.     "Fernandez said that some points may have been missed in the appreciation of the case for which reason he will be filing a motion for reconsideration of the (Ombudsman's) resolution," the statement said.     Central bank sources said the statement was drafted after Fernandez and senior deputy governor Gabriel Singson, who is in Manila, conferred on the telephone.     Gonzalez said his office ordered the charges filed after hearing submissions by Fernandez and plaintiff Paula Paug, the president of Pacific Bank's Employees Union.     In her complaint, Paug said Fernandez had acted arbitrarily in ordering the closure of Pacific Bank and placing it under receivership without giving the bank the right to appeal, throwing hundreds of employees out of work.     Paug also said Fernandez had not withdrawn his stockholding in Far East Bank and Trust Company, which took over Pacific Bank's assets, when he became central bank governor in January, 1984. Fernandez founded Far East in 1960.     She alleged Fernandez had misused his position by appointing two Far East bank executives to central bank consultancies, giving them access to Pacific Bank records. She also disputed Fernandez' interpretation of Pacific's accounts from January 1980 to May 1985, claiming the bank had made a profit, not a loss.     The central bank statement quoted Fernandez as stressing that Pacific Bank was "repeatedly given notice of the continuing losses of the bank and the immediate need of putting up additional capital to eliminate insolvency."     It said the central bank tried to assist in a bid by Bank of Hawaii and Philippine sugar trader Antonio Chan to purchase Pacific Bank, but the negotiations collapsed "because of certain legal impediments."     The statement said the central bank invited several banks to submit offers for Pacific, and the sale to Far East was approved by the Monetary Board and not by Fernandez alone.     Fernandez was also quoted in the statement as saying he had divested himself of all interests in Far East Bank when he became central bank governor. A Far East Bank spokesman declined comment on the charges against Fernandez.     In a footnote to a 12-page resolution recommending prosecution against Fernandez, Gonzalez said prima facie evidence of misuse of power also existed against all the then members of the country's Monetary Board, as well as the Far East executives, and ordered their investigation.     He said Fernandez's action fitted in with the political climate during former President Ferdinand Marcos's final years.     "(The) prevailing mood of the day for those in high offices was either to imitate the penchant of then President Marcos and his wife, to run roughshod over the human rights of citizens ... Or to follow blindly or with canine devotion any instructions from above," Gonzalez wrote.     Gonzalez, named to his post 11 months ago, said his office had received more than 4,000 complaints of misuse of power. He said among those facing prosecution were five provincial governors appointed by President Corazon Aquino.  REUTER ;

TEST;24-MAR-1987 11:12:30.03;NATIONAL SEMICONDUCTOR<NSM> CITES IMPROVED RESULTS;  National Semiconductor Corp said improved results at its Semiconductor Group helped reduce losses in the third quarter and nine months.     In the quarter ended March 8, the group had a modest sales increase and major improvement in operating performance compared to the year-ago quarter, the company said.     But results softened from the prior quarter because of low bookings last fall for third quarter shipment and holiday shutdowns, it said.     The semiconductor maker cut net losses to 25.6 mln dlrs or 31 cts a share from 39.4 mln dlrs or 47 cts in the quarter.     Losses in the nine months were reduced to 32.7 mln dlrs or 44 cts from 84.4 mln dlrs or one dlr. Sales grew 23.5 pct in the quarter to 398.1 mln dlrs and 25.5 pct in the nine months to 1.36 billion dlrs.     Bookings recovered in the latter part of the third quarter, the company said. Despite the improvement in order rates and operating results year-to-year, pricing continues to be "aggressive for many products," it said.     Nevertheless, it expects the semiconductor business will continue to improve this year. The Information Systems Group will continue strong sales growth based on recent order trends and new product introductions, it said.  Reuter ;

The company said the remainder of its write-off would include a one-time expense for future costs related to early retirement programs, office consolidations and an increase in the general reserve for adjustments and contingencies.     Bruce Wilkinson, president of the company, said the charges to the company's third quarter earnings, for the period ending March 31, would "significantly impact" third quarter results but would not affect the company's cash position.     "We expect to have the biggest operating backlog in the company's history by June 30, 1987, the end of our fiscal year," Wilkinson said. "We believe the action being proposed will begin to contribute to improved earnings in the fourth quarter of our fiscal 1987 and throughout fiscal 1988."     The company, which is one of the nation's largest construction firms, also said termination of its defined benefit retirement plan would produce a pre-tax benefit of about 10 mln dlrs due to overfunding of the plan.

TEST;24-MAR-1987 13:34:37.48;FAIRCHILD <FEN> SEEKS OKAY FOR REINCORPOATION;  Fairchild Industries Inc said it will ask stockholders at its April 22 annual meeting to approve its reincorporation in Delaware to allow more flexibility to revise its capital structure, among other things. Fairchild is now a Maryland corporation.     Fairchild also cited Delaware's recently enacted statutory provisions relating to directors' liability, allowing companies to place limits on liability and expand their ablility to protect corporate officers.     William E. Fulwider, company spokesman, said Fairchild has no specific plans to alter its capital structure.     Fairchild said that if stockholders approve the reincorporation, it would merge into a Delaware corporation and its common and preferred would be automatically converted to  the new corporation's shares, without any exchange of stock, along with other assets and liabilities.     Fairchild also said the new corporation would retain its fair price charter provision.     Earlier this month, Fairchild announced that it reached an agreement with the Air Force to stop production on the T-46A trainer jet.     As a result, Fairchild said, it will close its Farmingdale, N.Y., plant this year and layoff most of the plant's 2,800 employees, about a quarter of its entire workforce.     Fairchild reported a 73.6 mln dlr fourth quarter loss mainly due to charges for the plant closing and ending of the trainer jet program.

TEST;24-MAR-1987 14:43:15.25;COCOA BUFFER STOCK ACCORD CLOSER, DELEGATES SAY;     By Lisa Vaughan, Reuters The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) moved closer to an agreement on buffer stock rules, with many delegates saying they expect to reach an accord by Friday.     "Everyone is convinced the buffer stock rules should be in place by Friday so the buffer stock can be put into operation Monday," a consumer delegate said. "The atmosphere is excellent."     Other delegates said the buffer stock might not be operational by Monday but could be in place by around April 1, if the rules are agreed by Friday.     A detailed package on how the buffer stock manager will buy and sell cocoa was presented to a buffer stock working group this afternoon -- a big step toward a "very interesting stage of negotiations," delegates said.     The package, based on negotiating principles informally agreed by delegates, has been forged bit by bit during fortnight-long meetings by ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn and a small group of other delegates.     Producers, the European Community (EC) and consumers are scheduled to consider the paper separately and then jointly tomorrow.     Under the proposal, the buffer stock manager would buy cocoa from origins or the second-hand market on an offer system. He would alert the market via news agencies as to when he wanted to buy cocoa and include shipment details and tonnage desired, delegates said.     The manager would buy cocoa on a competitive basis, rather than choosing the cheapest cocoa as before, giving preference to ICCO member-country exporters. Standard price differentials would be fixed for each origin, similar to golf handicaps, to determine the relative competitiveness of offers of various cocoas from different origins, they said.     The differentials could be reviewed at the request of a member country or recommendation of the buffer stock manager, the delegates said. Revision would be decided by a majority vote of the ICCO council.     Buffer stock purchases from non-ICCO member countries would not be allowed to exceed 10 pct of the total buffer stock, they said.     The purchases would be limited to 5,000 tonnes of cocoa per day and 20,000 tonnes per week, and could be bought in nearby, intermediate and forward positions, they added.     One of the underlying ideas of the rules package is "transparency," meaning virtually all the buffer stock manager's market activities will be public and he will have as little discretion as possible, delegates said.     After the tin market collapse in 1985, when the International Tin Council buffer stock ran out of funds, cocoa delegates are anxious to install safeguards in the cocoa market mechanism, they said.      Earnest debate on the buffer stock proposal is expected to begin late tomorrow, as delegations feel the pressure of the approaching Friday deadline, when the ICCO meeting is due to adjourn, delegates said.     The ICCO failed to agree buffer stock rules in January when the new International Cocoa Agreement came into force. The existing buffer stock of 100,000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen in place with its bank balance of 250 mln dlrs -- both untouchable until rules are agreed.      Though the current semi-annual council meeting is not the last chance for delegates to cement buffer stock rules, producers are keen to get the wheels of the market-stabilizing mechanism turning to stem the decline in world prices, delegates said.

This extension of the expiration date is conditioned on no person acquiring beneficial ownership of 20 pct or more of Gencorp's common stock prior to April 3, it said.     Gencorp said it could distribute the rights certificates to shareholders 10 to 30 days after the March 18 acquisition offer was made.     However, rather than leaving the expiration date in a range, the board decided to set April 3 as the day it will distribute the preferred share purchase rights.      Reuter ;

Patt A. Gibbs, president of the 10,000-member APFA, said the union took the action following the firing of 17 flight attendants who had been handing out information brochures at American's terminals at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport.     The union has been negotiating for a new contract with the American Airlines for the past seven months. The union is seeking abolishment by the airline of a two-tier wage system for flight attendants.

It said the existing five-year agreement, due to expire this July 24, was extended until the end of 1988 to allow for additional geological and geophysical studies.     Amoco has so far laid 7,100 km of seismic lines and sunk five exploration wells in the Morondava basin. It may drill a further three wells before the end of the extended exploration period, the statement said.     Madagascar has signed oil exploration agreements with four foreign oil companies since 1981. But despite promising indications of large reserves, no commercial production plans have yet been announced.     The foreign firms - Amoco, Occidental Petroleum Corp <OXY>, Mobil Corp <MOB> and a unit of <Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi> - are working in partnership with the National Military Office for Strategic Industries (OMNIS).

TEST;25-MAR-1987 05:24:46.68;BAT SEES STRONG PERFORMANCE FROM ALL SECTORS;  A strong performance from all BAT Industries Plc's <BTI.L> major sectors enabled the group's 1986 pretax profits to pass the one billion stg level for the third year running, Chairman Patrick Sheehy said in a statement.     The group earlier reported a 19 pct rise in profits to 1.39 billion, which Sheehy said was achieved without any help from exchange rate fluctuations or acquisitions.     Good results were achieved by its Argos and Saks Fifth Avenue in retailing and by Wiggins Teape and Appleton in paper.     Tobacco accounted for about 50 pct of profit with a four pct gain to 764 mln stg and a two pct increase in world volume.     The results were largely in line with analysts expectations and BAT shares firmed by two pence to 537p at 0955 GMT.     BAT said the U.S. Brown and Williamson unit held most of its 1985 gains and increased profit 18 pct in dollar terms.     Financial services saw profits double to 282 mln with both Eagle Star and Allied Dunbar achieving further growth.     Allied Dunbar reported a 51 pct rise in life annual premiums to 39 mln stg. BAT said it increased new business by 38 pct in the last nine months after a relatively slow first quarter. Its permanent health insurance was now the market leader and its Unit Trust group was now the second largest in the U.K.     Eagle Star general premiums rose 32 pct to 1.03 billion. Its life activities also grew 39 pct with better underwriting results in the second half.     Cash flow was strong and the gross debt to equity ratio dropped to 41 pct from 51 pct. The net ratio, at 26 pct, left the group strongly placed to pursue its further development.     Profits from paper and pulp grew 29 pct to 217 mln stg, nearly three times the 1982 level, with Wiggins Teape's sales rising 36 pct to pass one billion stg.     BAT said in 1986 it had sold 88 BATUS stores in the U.S. For 644 mln dlrs and sold Grovewood Securities for 142 mln stg.  REUTER ;

TEST;25-MAR-1987 07:09:17.42;ABU DHABI TO REOPEN GULF OILFIELD HIT IN 1986 RAID;  Abu Dhabi's offshore Abu al-Bukhoosh oilfield in the Gulf, shut since an aerial attack last November, will reopen when new anti-aircraft defences are ready, and this could be in the next two months, oil industry sources said.     They said the Abu Dhabi government and Compagnie Francaise des Petroles (Total) <TPN.PA>, whose Total Abu al-Bukhoosh subsidiary owns 51 pct of the field, have agreed on the reopening, but that a date has not been definitely fixed.     Unidentified planes hit the field, 100 miles off Abu Dhabi, last November 25.     The raid killed eight workers and destroyed the main living quarters and a bridge linking a wellhead to the main production platform.     Western diplomats in the region say Iran was responsible but Tehran has blamed its Gulf War enemy Iraq.     Abu al-Bukhoosh was producing 57,000 barrels per day (bpd) at the time of the attack, but the sources said it would resume at a maximum of half that level because of reduced staff and the fact only four of five wellheads were now operable.     The sources said only 80 personnel can be housed in remaining accomodations, the sources said.     Facilities being installed to protect the field include aircraft detection equipment, anti-aircraft missiles, housing for military personnel and helicopter landing pads, the sources said.     Abu Dhabi is the largest oil producer in the United Arab Emirates, accounting for about 800,000 bpd of its total 1.15 mln bpd production, the sources said.     They also said Iran was working to reopen its Sassan field, part of the same reservoir as Abu al-Bukhoosh and located only a few miles away. Sassan was heavily damaged by an Iraqi air raid only 10 days before Abu al-Bukhoosh was attacked.  REUTER ;
TEST;25-MAR-1987 07:28:52.81;EXCHANGE RATES ALMOST WITHIN G-6 LEVELS - SUMITA;  Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said that current exchange rates are almost within the levels agreed to by six major nations last month in Paris.     Asked whether a dollar/yen rate of 148 or 149 reflected economic fundamentals, he said current rates almost reflect fundamentals.     Sumita told reporters major nations have cooperated to bring about currency stability in line with the Paris agreement, which stipulated that they would closely cooperate to that end. He repeated the central bank will intervene if necessary, adding he did not think a dollar free-fall was likely.     But Sumita said he could not say exactly what currency levels would be considered in line with underlying economic fundamentals.     In Paris on February 22, Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate to hold currencies around their then current levels.     Sumita said he could not find any specific reasons behind the fall of the dollar to a record low against the yen yesterday. But he said the market rushed to sell dollars as it nervously reacted to statements abroad and to developments surrounding trade tensions.     U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said over the weekend that the Paris pact did not encompass fixed tragets for the dollar. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter called U.S/Japan relations on certain key trade issues very strained.     The market reacted nervously because the dollar has been moving narrowly against the yen since mid-January, Sumita said. He added he does not expect the yen/dollar exchange rate to remain unstable because the market is concerned about a sharp rise of the yen.     The Bank of Japan will keep a close watch on exchange rates in line with the Paris accord, he added.  REUTER ;

The officials told Reuters MITI asked them to moderate their foreign exchange trading because the excessive rise in the yen will have unfavourable effects on the economy. It made the request by telephone.     A MITI official said the ministry has conducted a survey of foreign exchange trading by trade houses and exporters. But he said it was not aimed at moderating dollar selling.     The trading house officials said MITI had asked them to undertake foreign exchange transactions with due consideration to the adverse effects excessive exchange rate movements would have on the economy.     The MITI official said MITI undertakes such surveys when exchange rates fluctuate widely. A similiar survey was made when the currency fell to the previous record low of 149.98 on January 19. It hit a new record low of 148.20 yen yesterday.     He said the survey showed currency transactions by trade houses and exporters contributed little to the dollar fall.  REUTER ;

The Bank of Japan here declined comment.     The Bank of England was also rumored to be buying dollars against the yen this morning but it also declined comment.     Dealers said the intervention halted a sudden late morning drop to a low of 148.65 yen, holding the dollar steady until midsession at about 148.80.     The Bank of England was strongly rumored to have intervened on behalf of the dollar against the yen yesterday, but it gave no confirmation.     Overnight reports from Tokyo said that the Bank of Japan was aggressively supporting the dollar, but failed to push it back to the perceived target level of 150 yen.     Selling during the London trading morning was largely attributed to Japanese institutions.     Dealers here were loath to quantify the scale of Bank of Japan action this morning. One U.S. Bank trader said it could have been up to 500 mln dlrs, but said this was largely a guess.  REUTER ;

Statoil will share the licence with subsidiaries of U.S. Oil companies Tenneco Inc <TGT.N> and Texas Eastern Corp <TET.N> and the Italian oil company <Agip SpA>'s Norwegian subsidiary.     E.I.

TEST;25-MAR-1987 09:53:07.03;BUNDESBANK BUYS DOLLARS IN FRANKFURT - DEALERS;  The Bundesbank bought large amounts of dollars for yen in an apparent attempt to hold the dollar above 149 yen, dealers said.     The dollar intervention was in concert with some other central banks, they said.     Dealers said the Bank of Japan and Bank of England supported the dollar against the yen earlier today and that these two banks and the U.S. Federal Reserve were also active yesterday.     The Bundesbank declined to comment on the dealers' remarks.     Dealers said the intervention underlined the determination of central banks to keep currencies within recent ranges following last month's agreement in Paris by six leading countries to foster currency stability.     One dealer said he had been repeatedly in contact with the Bundesbank during the morning to see if it wanted to buy dollars after the Japanese and U.K. Central bank moves.     He said the Bundesbank told him it was observing the situation to see if it should intervene in consultation with other central banks.     Since the Paris agreement on February 22 the dollar had until yesterday traded in a 1.8150-1.8700 mark range, and above 150 yen, with traders reluctant to push the dollar down to test central banks' resolve to defend currency stability.     But the test came this week with the dollar falling below 1.81 marks and 150 yen. Dealers said a reviving trade dispute between Washington and Tokyo and growing sentiment that the dollar would have to fall further to narrow the obstinate U.S. Trade deficit were behind the weakness.     This week's intervention showed central banks were prepared to cooperate to defend the Paris pact, dealers said.     Dealers said it was significant the West German and British central banks were supporting the dollar against the yen.     That showed the pact involved multilateral cooperation by central banks to foster currency stability, they said.     But it was unclear how such cooperation was being arranged and how frequent consultations between central banks were.  REUTER ;

He told the Legislative Council there had been widespread misunderstanding, speculation and unfair distortion of the reasons for the decision.

TEST;25-MAR-1987 13:32:52.76;PACIFIC GAS <PCG> SEEKS PURCHASE RULE CHANGE;  Pacific Gas and Electric Co said it will ask the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to change federal regulations requiring the utility to buy electricity from unregulated private producers.     Prices paid for this power under long term contracts signed before last year's fall in world oil prices now are more than twice as high as the actual value of the electricity, Pacific Gas said.     Under the 1978 Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act utilities are required to buy electricity from cogeneration facilities, which produce both steam and electricity.     Since 1980, Pacific Gas has signed power purchase agreements, required by the law, with long-term price guarantees for more than 8,480 megawatts of capacity from private producers, the company said.     About 1,870 MW of that capacity is already on line, and accounted for about eight pct of the company's total energy sales in 1986, Pacific Gas said.     The company said it will ask FERC to amend the rules requiring purchase of this power so that the price paid for the electricity reflects current market values, and that utilities be required to buy only electricity needed in the near term.     Contracts with cogeneration and other small power projects could cost Pacific Gas' consumers as much as 857 mln dlrs annually by 1990, the company said.     The 857 mln dlrs represents the difference between what Pacific Gas would pay for power from private producers and the cost to the company to produce the power on its own or buy it elsewhere, Pacific Gas said.

TEST;25-MAR-1987 13:35:07.68;BRAZIL PLANS NEW ECONOMIC STRATEGY FOR GROWTH;  Brazil is preparing a new economic strategy intended to protect domestic growth, Finance Ministry sources said.     A presidential spokesman said President Jose Sarney had authorised the government's economic team to prepare the new plan as soon as possible.     Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said last night the plan would reflect "an important battle to protect the country's development and keep it from recession."     Funaro, who helped lead the anti-inflation Cruzado Plan launched in February 1986, has come under increasing attack over the past few days following the resignation of Planning Minister Joao Sayad on March 17. Observers say the plan has failed to stabilise the country's economy.     Sayad submitted a new package calling for a 90-day prices and a wage freeze, but met opposition from Sarney and Funaro.     Foreign Ministry sources said the new strategy was being prepared by economists Persio Arida and Andre Lara Resende, both former Central Bank officials said to have played leading roles in the Cruzado Plan.    The new plan will define the terms on which Brazil will seek rescheduling of its 109 billion dlr foreign debt.     On February 20, Brazil suspended servicing of 70 billion dlrs of debt to private foreign banks.     Funaro said last night Brazil wants a rescheduling program spread over four years, and added that it had to include new loans to keep the domestic economy growing.     "In the past two years Brazil paid 24 billion dlrs in servicing of its foreign debt, while only getting two billion dlrs in new loans," Funaro said.   REUTER ;

The company said it has filed for an offering of four mln common shares and 150 mln dlrs of subordinated debentures due 2017, with proceeds to be used to refinance the short-term bank debt incurred for the AccuRay acquisition, to finance other costs of the transaction and for general corporate purposes.     Combustion said 3,500,000 shares will be sold in the U.S. and the remainder overseas.     Combustion paid about 218 mln dlrs for AccuRay, a maker of computer-based measurement and control systems used in pulp and paper mills.     The company said it expects to release first quarter results in the third week in April.     Combustion said it expects further restructuring of core businesses -- particularly Lummus Crest -- this year through staff reductions downsizings and the consolidation of facilities.     Combustion said the restructuring at Lummus Crest is expected to substantially reduce but not eliminate this year losses in the Engineering and Construction segment.     But it said improvement at Lummus Crest is expected to be approximately offset by a number of factors, including a somewhat lower level of earnings in the Power Generation segment than in 1986, financing costs of the AccuRay acquisition, costs associated with integrating AccuRay technology and operations and delays in waste to energy projects.

TEST;25-MAR-1987 13:56:21.35;TALKING POINT/TOBACCO STOCKS;     By Gary Seidman, Reuters Stocks of tobacco companies rose sharply as investors grew more confident that an excise tax would not be imposed on tobacco, traders and analysts said.     They also said the stocks are relatively inexpensive since fear of the tax and of pending litigation regarding warning labels for tobacco products have kept many investors away recently.     Philip Morris Cos <MO> rose 2-5/8 to 87-3/4, RJR Nabisco <RJR> 1-1/4 to 57-1/2 and U.S. Tobacco <UBO> 7/8 to 27.     "The near-term activity of these stocks has been dominated by external factors such as smoking restriction legislation, concern over liability suits and the possible imposition of excise taxes," Dean Witter analyst Lawrence Adelman said. "But the feeling is that many of those externals have been discounted in the price of the stocks."     Adelman, who issued a positive recommendation on Philip Morris earlier this week, said there have been indications that the Reagan Administration's staunch opposition to tax hikes would short-circuit attempts to tax tobacco.     "The tobaccos do have more risks than regular consumer stocks because of these external factors," Adelman said. "They are not for the weak-hearted, but they offer a lot of value for the aggressive investor."     In a market where everyone is looking for affordable stocks, trader Drew Schaefer of Kidder Peabody said, it is not hard to understand why the tobaccos, which have been depressed for a while in a positive market, are attracting buyers.     Adelman believes one of the better buys is Philip Morris. "It is a powerhouse of potential growth in earnings, dividends and free cash flow. And the stock is cheap now," he said.     Adelman expects Morris to earn eight dlrs a share this year compared to 6.20 dlrs a share earned a year ago. In 1988, the company should report a profit 10.30 dlrs a share.  Reuter ;

"Our position with respect to the dollar goes back to the Paris Agreement that the currencies were within ranges broadly consistent with underlying economic conditions," Baker told a Senate committee.     Baker continued, "We said further that we and others are willing to cooperate closely to foster stability in exchange rates around those levels."     He referred to a February agreement by six leading industrial nations to cooperate on monetary matters.     Baker refused to answer a question whether Japan and Germany had done enough to stimulate their domestic economies for the United States to support the dollar.     "I will not comment because the foreign exchange market reads more or less than is intended in my statements," Baker said.     Baker said that the other signatories recognized that they must carry their share of the load of correcting external imbalances that have hindered the world's economy.     He cited news reports that Germany would increase a proposed tax cut for 1988 by about five billion marks to stimulate domestic growth.     Japan also agreed to consider stimulative measures after the Japanese budget was made final.

TEST;25-MAR-1987 15:17:12.79;U.S. GOVERNMENT EXPANDS CRACKDOWN ON BAD DEBTS;  The administration is expanding its crackdown on bad debts, officials of the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) told reporters.     OMB Deputy Director Joseph Wright said the administration this year plans to turn over to private credit rating firms data on about 3.5 mln "deadbeats" who are seriously behind or in default in their payments on federal loans.     Next year, the government will turn over to private collection bureaus four billion dlrs in bad education loans and three billion dlrs in other bad government loans, Wright said.     The government is also considering letting individuals make payments on their student loans with credit cards, officials told reporters.     The Internal Revenue Service is already studying the use of credit cards to pay income taxes, but this usage would require a change in federal law while no congressional action would be needed for credit cards to be used for student loans, the officials said.     The officials disclosed these plans in releasing the third annual OMB report to Congress on management of the U.S. government.     The report details steps to be taken by the administration to increase federal efficiency and to continue President Reagan's highly publicized "war on waste, fraud and abuse."     According to the report, elinquent U.S. debt had soared to 68.3 billion dlrs, or 18.8 pct of total receivables, by the end of the fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30. At the end of fiscal 1981, when Reagan took office, bad debt stood at 29.8 billion dlrs or 12.3 pct of total debt.     But OMB officials said other Reagan administration efforts had already saved taxpayers 84 billion dlrs and would save another 25 billion dlrs or so by the time Reagan left office.  Reuter ;
TEST;25-MAR-1987 15:30:34.97;CANADA MAY MONITOR STEEL SHIPMENTS;  Canada may begin monitoring steel flowing in and out of the country to determine if any steel is being illegally "trans-shipped" to the U.S., senior government trade officials said.     The officials, asking not to be identified, said the government will investigate an industry contention that steel  imported from countries such as South Korea and Taiwan is being diverted to the U.S. and ultimately exasperating concerns about the level of Canadian exports south of the border.     But the senior officials, asking not to be indentified, said that despite intense pressure from the Reagan Administration, Ottawa was not considering any kind of formal limits on Canadian shipments to the U.S.     "In a sense what I hope we are doing is buying some time," said one official who claimed Canadian companies were "fair traders" in the big American market.     If approved by the Canadian cabinet, the officials said a  monitoring system will be established in the next three or four months.     "I guess if we find trans-shipment is a problem, we would have to do something about it," said a trade official.     Canadian steel shipments to the U.S. have risen to 5.7 pct of the U.S. market in recent months, almost double the level just two years ago.     The increase in Canadian shipments comes at a time of growing anger in the U.S. over rising steel imports from several countries in the face of a decline among domestic steel producers.     Some U.S. lawmakers have proposed Canada's share of the American market be limited to 2.4 per cent.     The Ontario Government has urged Ottawa to require foreign companies to obtain permits to import steel into the country. Currently, import licences are required only for carbon or raw steel, which makes up less than half the steel market.     Canada exported two billion Canadian dlrs worth of steel in 1986, while importing 944-mln dlrs worth of the product in the same year.  Reuter ;

To qualify for a Class A rating, a state must keep its herd infection rate at or below 0.25 pct for 12 months.

"It's a bad idea. We don't need more money to balance the budget. We need to reduce spending and avoid things that would halt economic expansion," Miller told students at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.     "I think economic growth could be threatened mightily if we have a tax increase or by the perception that we're giving up on deficit reduction," he said.     Miller criticised a proposal by House speaker Jim Wright to put a one pct tax on securities transactions.     He said the tax would probably be ineffective because people would avoid by holding their portfolios in other instruments, like real estate, or simply by not trading as often.     Miller said he doubted this proposal would pass.     "I think it is frankly all but political suicide to advocate a tax increase unless the president championed it as well," he said. "And he's not going to do it, in fact he would veto a tax increase," Miller added.  Reuter ;

They are Chase Manhattan Corp <CMB>, Chemical New York Corp <CHL>, Irving Bank Corp <V>, Manufacturers Hanover Corp <MHC>, Mellon Financial Corp <MEL> and Security Pacific Corp <SPC>.     S and P said the action on Chase, Chemical, Irving and Manufacturers primarily reflected continued vulnerability to lesser developed countries and median financial performance.     Standard and Poor's said its downgrade of Chemical also reflected that holding company's acquisition of Texas Commerce Bancshares <TCB>, which was just now approved by the Federal Reserve.     For Mellon and Security Pacific, S and P cited higher non-performing assets and weaker operating earnings.     The rating agency said it completed a review, based on 1986 results, of the largest U.S. bank holding companies. It paid special attention to reassessing the effect of exposures to lesser developed countries on the holding companies' earnings and capital.     "Brazil's unilateral moratorium on debt service payments underscored the potential for polarization between bankers and debtor countries," S and P said.     S and P noted that while Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela each face unique economic problems, the lack of progress toward moderating their debt service burdens has been disappointing.     However, the agency pointed out that a substantive improvement in the large banks' financial positions has acted as a counter-balance to the Latin American debt situation.     Citing increasing financial strength, S and P said it affirmed the debt ratings of Citicorp <CCI>, Bankers Trust New York Corp <BT>, Bank of Boston Corp <BKB> and J.P. Morgan and Co Inc <JPM>.     S and P noted that most U.S. bank holding companies have what it termed easily realizable capital resources available to them, such as undervalued real estate, appreciated portfolio securities and overfunded pension plans.     "Most bank managements appear committed to improving the quality of their balance sheets," S and P said, noting many now emphasize long-term strategies over short-term earnings.     Standard and Poor's reduced Chase Manhattan's senior debt to AA-minus from AA, subordinated debt to A-plus from AA-minus and preferred stock to A from A-plus. The commercial paper of the parent and its unit Chase Manhattan Bank of Canada were affirmed at A-1-plus.     Chase has 3.2 billion dlrs of debt outstanding. It has 6.4 billion dlrs of loans to Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela - one of the highest exposures to lesser developed countries among U.S. money centers.     Chase's underlying profitability remains at median levels because of its high expense structure, S and P said.     S and P cut Chemical's and the unit Chemical New York N.V.'s senior debt to AA-minus from AA and subordinated debt to A-plus from AA-minus.     About 1.2 billion dlrs of long-term debt was affected.     The agency cited Chemical's relatively large exposure to Latin American borrowers, particulary Brazil and Mexico, continued high levels of nonperforming assets and the pending acquisition of Texas Commerce.     Aggregate exposure to Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela was almost four billion dlrs at year-end 1986, or 105 pct of equity and reserves, S and P pointed out.     Irving's senior debt was reduced to A-plus from AA-minus, with subordinated debt and preferred stock lowered to A from A-plus. Its commercial paper was affirmed at A-111-1plus.     Irving has about 500 mln dlrs of debt outstanding. Its approximately 1.4 billion dlrs of loans to the four major Latin debtor countries account for 110 pct of year-end equity and reserves.     S and P downgraded Manufacturers Hanover's senior debt to A from A-plus, subordinated debt to A-minus from A and preferred stock to BBB-plus from A-minus but affirmed its A-1 commercial paper. The bank has 3.8 billion dlrs of debt.     S and P noted that Manufacturers has about 6.7 billion dlrs of loans to the major Latin debtor nations and has experienced weak earnings.     However, the unit CIT Group Holdings Inc's AA-minus senior debt and A-1-plus commercial paper were affirmed.     The rating agency cut Mellon's senior debt to A-plus from AA and preferred stock to A from AA-minus. It has 1.1 billion dlrs of debt securities.     The commercial paper programs of Mellon Bank Canada and Mellon Australia Ltd, guaranteed by the parent company, were lowered to A-1 from A-1-plus.     S and P cited continued lower operating earnings and rising nonperforming assets and charge-offs for Mellon.     Security Pacific's 1.7 billion dlrs of debt was downgraded. Cut were its senior debt to AA from AA-plus, and subordinated debt and preferred stock to AA-minus from AA.     Security Pacific Overseas Finance N.V.'s debt issues were reduced to AA from AA-plus. Affirmed were the parent's A-1-plus commercial paper and the BBB-rated debt of the unit Security Pacific Financial Systems.     These actions reflected Security Pacific's continued high levels of nonperforming assets and charge-offs, S and P said.  Reuter ;

Edward Zorinsky, remains in doubt.     Zorinsky's death earlier this month cut the Democrats' majority on the committee to 9-8.     Zorinsky's replacement, Republican David Karnes, has said he would like a seat on the panel, and Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.) is said to have thrown his support behind Karnes, who would add a Midwestern vote to the panel.     But Karnes' appointment to the committee would require at least one Republican to step off the committee.     Aides to Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and Pete Wilson (Calif.), whose spots on the panel were rumored to be in jeopardy, said their bosses were categorically opposed to being pushed off the committee.     Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) told Reuters he had rejected a suggestion that Democrats and Republicans each add one member to the committee.     Leahy said he would be "delighted" to have freshman Sen. John Breaux (D-La.) join the committee. But Breaux's appointment was being resisted by Midwestern Democrats, who feel southern states are adequately represented on the committee.     An aide to Sen. James Exon (D-Neb.) said the senator, supported by Midwestern Democrats, had not ruled out the possibility of moving to the committee.     The inability of the two parties to settle the matter could increase the possibility that the Democratic majority would be left untouched at 9-8.

TEST;26-MAR-1987 01:27:34.81;SINGAPORE RULE CHANGES SEEN HAVING LITTLE IMPACT;  Revisions to the by-laws of the Stock Exchange of Singapore to be introduced on April 1 will have little impact on the market, brokers and analysts said.     One analyst did say, however, that the removal of fixed commissions on transactions in government securities and Asian currency bonds would increase trading volume, because most deals before were transacted directly between clients.     One change will allow stockbroking firms to advertise, but brokers said this would not have much effect because most corporate clients already know the market well.     Many remisiers (brokers' agents) and dealers criticised the exchange for not taking the opportunity to abolish or cut transfer fees on remisiers moving to other firms.     One remisier said the transfer fees inhibit an efficient broking system because they restrict brokers' movements.     But most remisiers welcomed the amendment to replace cash deposits with bank guarantees for business transactions. Where an extra deposit is needed, it can in future be either in cash or in securities approved by the exchange.     Other remisiers felt the new rule that they must report all transactions involving 50,000 dlrs or more to the exchange was unnecessary.     Another revision says broking firms are not allowed to improve a buying and selling quote by more than one bid during the last five minutes of trading.  REUTER ;

TEST;26-MAR-1987 05:24:07.86;GERMAN CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS WIDENS IN FEBRUARY;  West Germany's current account surplus widened to a provisional 6.6 billion marks in February from a slightly downwards revised 4.8 billion in January, a spokeswoman for the Federal Statistics Office said.     The trade surplus in February widened to a provisional 10.4 billion marks from 7.2 billion in January, she added.     The Statistics Office had originally put the January current account surplus at 4.9 billion marks.     The February trade surplus was well up on the 6.84 billion mark surplus posted in the same month of 1986. But the current account surplus was down slightly from the 6.85 billion surplus recorded in February 1986.     A Statistics Office statement said the widening of the February current account surplus compared with January was due to seasonal factors. Neither the trade nor current account figures are seasonally adjusted.     February imports, measured in terms of value, totalled 32.11 billion marks, a decline of 10 pct against February 1986 but a rise of 5.5 pct against January.     Exports in February, also in value terms, totalled 42.56 billion marks, 0.5 pct less than in February 1986 but up 13 pct compared with January.     The Statistics Office said it was not yet able to calculate the real change in exports and imports in February. But for comparison purposes it noted that in January the average value of imports had fallen 15 pct year-on-year while the average value of exports had declined by only 4.4 pct.     Within the current account, the services account had 300 mln marks deficit, supplementary trade items a 200 mln mark surplus while transfer payments posted a 3.7 billion mark deficit.     Taking the first two months of 1987 together, imports in value terms fell 14 pct to 62.6 billion marks compared with a year earlier. The value of exports totalled 80.2 billion marks, a decline of 7.4 pct against the same months of 1986.     The resulting trade surplus of 17.6 billion marks for January/February compares with a cumulative surplus of 14.1 billion marks in the year-ago period.     The cumulative current account surplus for January and February 1987 totalled 11.3 billion marks against 11.4 billion marks a year earlier, the Statistics Office said.     Bank economists said the rise in the February trade surplus reflected an improvement in the terms of trade as well as seasonal factors. The Federal Statistics Office said earlier this week that February import prices fell 0.7 pct against January while export prices were unchanged.     "The rise in the nominal figures masks a lower export trend that is not expected to change for several months at least," said an economist. He said the nominal trade surplus for 1987 as a whole is likely to fall only slightly from the record 112.2 billion marks in 1986 but other economists said the surplus could fall to around 80 billion marks.     An economist at the Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft (BfG) in Frankfurt said a two-month comparison of trade figures gave a more accurate picture of West Germany's trade position.     He noted the 17.6 billion mark surplus for January and February together was lower than the 21.6 billion mark surplus posted in November and December.     "The trend is clearly lower," he said.     This economist, who declined to be named, said the February rise was also partly explained by special factors in January, when there had been a number of public holidays as well as extremely cold weather, both of which hindered trade.

TEST;26-MAR-1987 07:21:27.37;IWC LIFTS WORLD GRAIN OUTPUT ESTIMATE TO RECORD;  The International Wheat Council (IWC) lifted its estimate for 1986/87 world wheat and coarse grain production by one mln tonnes to a record 1,377 mln, compared with 1,351 mln tonnes the previous season.     In its monthly market report, the IWC said it is leaving unchanged its forecast of world wheat production for the coming 1987/88 season at between 520 and 530 mln tonnes against a record 534 mln in 1986/87. The one mln tonne upward revision in 1986/87 wheat production reflects several minor adjustments. The IWC raised the 1986/87 coarse grain trade figure two mln to 87 mln tonnes. It left wheat trade unchanged at 86 mln.     The IWC 1986/87 estimate for world trade in wheat and coarse grain is thus estimated two mln tonnes higher at 173 mln against 169 mln the previous season with the forecast three mln rise in Soviet imports offset by small reductions elsewhere.     The IWC said the area harvested for wheat in 1987/88 is likely to be down from last year as low world prices and restrictive national policies measures begin to take effect.     At least four of the five major exporters expect to see a drop in wheat sowings without offset in other countries. There is still potential for even higher average wheat yields but the IWC said there are increasing signs world output may level off.     Although it is still early to assess the coarse grain outlook, the IWC said barley acreage is likely to fall in the European Community but increase in Canada. U.S. Maize area is expected lower but oat sowings could rise.     After damage to its maize crop last year, the Soviet Union plans to expand this area by as much as 50 pct to over six mln hectares in a year when many frost damaged wheat fields are likely to be resown to this and other spring crops. Improved weather and a further increase in the use of intensive cultivation methods could therefore see a marked rise in Soviet maize output in 1987, the IWC said.     Any reduction in world coarse grain output would be bolstered by the large carryover stocks from 1986/87, the IWC said.     It left its estimates of wheat and coarse grain stocks at endof different marketing years unchanged at 178 and 210 mln tonnes, respectively, against 160 and 167 mln a year earlier.     After record world durum wheat production of 218.8 mln tonnes last season, the IWC said there are already signs of another large crop this coming season with higher output expected in the EC, Canada, the U.S. And North Africa.

TEST;26-MAR-1987 07:26:20.14;U.K. TRADE FIGURES BUOY HOPES OF INTEREST RATE CUT;     By Rowena Whelan, Reuters The release of U.K. February trade data showing that the current account surplus was a provisional 376 mln stg, up from a 73 mln surplus in January, has boosted hopes of an early cut in interest rates, analysts said.     Market forecasts had been for a worse outcome, with expectations of a deficit in visible trade averaging about 750 mln stg, against the official figure of 224 mln stg, sharply narrower than January's 527 mln deficit.     "The figures are unreservedly good," Chase Manhattan Securities economist Andrew Wroblewski said.     Sterling rebounded on the trade figures, reversing a weaker morning trend, to stand at 72.1 pct of its trade weighted index against a basket of currencies at midday, unchanged from yesterday's close but 0.3 points above the 1100 GMT level.     The market had feared that a deteriorating non-oil trade pattern would undermine international support for sterling, which has been the motor behind the recent fall in U.K. Interest rates. Money market sources said the market had begun to doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending rates to 9.5 pct from the present 10.0 pct was really on the cards.     But sentiment now looks to have turned about again.     There now looks to be no danger that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's forecast of a 1987 current account deficit of 2.5 billion stg will be exceeded, Wroblewski said.     Seasonally adjusted figures showed imports rose in February to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January.     Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion from 6.20 billion.     However, Chris Tinker, U.K. Analyst at brokers Phillips and Drew said the faster rise in exports than imports would prove partly aberrational in coming months. He forecast the Chancellor's Budget tax cuts would increase consumer expenditure on imported goods.     However, Warburg Securities economist Ian Harwood said his firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficit forecast in the light of the latest data, cutting one billion stg off the expected full year total to about 1.75 billion stg.     He said news of strong growth in exports of non-oil goods confirmed recent bullish surveys among members of the Confederation of British Industry.     The growth in imports appears to be flattening, even if January's bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseas goods and import-intensive stock building among manufacturers, Harwood said.     U.K. Government bonds, or gilts, surged by more than 1/2 point on the better-than-expected news, as earlier worries about the figures evaporated.     Sterling peaked at a high of 1.6075 dlrs, before settling to a steady 1.6050 about 1300 GMT, nearly a cent higher than the European low of 1.5960.     However, analysts noted that the turnabout in market sentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news.     Morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was largely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that the Conservative government's support was slipping.  The Bank of England said it provided 15 mln stg in assistance to the money market this morning, buying bank bills in band two at 9-13/16 pct.     Earlier the Bank revised its money market liquidity forecast from a flat position to a deficit of around 350 mln stg.  REUTER ;

TEST;26-MAR-1987 10:21:14.61;ALUMINIUM SCRAP RECOVERY AND USAGE TO RISE;  Aluminium scrap recovery and usage and output of secondary metal will continue to rise, said Shearson Lehman Brothers in a review of the secondary aluminium market which details cost and demand factors.     Although primary smelting costs have declined generally in recent years, the still substantial energy cost savings offered by secondary smelters will continue to make re-melted material increasingly attractive.     It takes around 15,000 kilowatt hours (kwh) of electricity to produce one tonne of primary aluminium compared with around 550 kwh for one tonne of secondary metal, Shearson said.     On the demand side, developments in automobiles and packaging bode well for secondary aluminium consumption.     Automobile production, although expected to fall this year, is still on an upward trend and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future and, in addition, use of aluminium castings is gaining wider acceptance in the automobile industry, particularly in the U.S.     In packaging, Shearson does not expect aluminium to dominate the beverage can market in any of the other major economies to the extent it does in the U.S., But says there is evidence recycling is on the increase in other countries.     In addition to the cost savings involved, technology advances now enable alloys of higher purity to be produced by the secondary aluminium industry, Shearson said.     There is not likely to be a problem of availability as the U.S. Has a huge scrap reservoir and this is also true of several European countries, albeit on a smaller scale.  Reuter ;

TEST;26-MAR-1987 11:47:02.79;FIRST INTERSTATE SEEKS ACQUISITION;     by Janie Gabbett Less than two months after First Interstate Bancorp withdrew its bold attempt to buy BankAmerica Corp, Chairman Joseph Pinola is still looking for a good buy, but he is also looking at ways to avoid being bought.     In a wide-ranging interview, Pinola said he's looking for ways to improve profitability and capital between now and 1991, "so as to resist any potential look at us...to maintain our independence, if possible."     In 1991 federal regulatory changes will allow the major East Coast banks to buy banks in California.     First Interstate, the fourth largest California bank, and the nineth largest nationwide, owns 24 banks in 12 western states and has franchise operations in four additional states.     Bank industry sources say it is an attractive target for large U.S. or foreign banks, looking to quickly move into the  lucrative California market and the West Coast region.     While declining specifics on his corporate strategy, when asked if acquisitions will be part of the plan, Pinola replied, "That's undoubtedly a fair statement...it would be almost naive not to think that."     Pinola characterized his acquisition strategy as "opportunistic".     He said he will look for banks in management trouble that he can get at a bargain, then add management to restore profitability, or for banks in states where First Interstate already operates, then cut costs by combining resources.     The exception, he said, would be Texas, where he said most of the banks are already well managed, but might be purchased at a discount because of the depressed regional economy.     Pinola declined comment on what circumstances might move him to rekindle his bid for BankAmerica, saying only, "We continue to monitor and look at a lot of things and a lot of people continue to monitor and look at us."     Banking analysts, however, consider another First Interstate bid at BankAmerica a long shot, not likely to happen any time soon.     Pinola called his decision last month to withdraw his 3.25 billion dlr bid at the nation's second largest bank, "a very, very difficult decision."     With that decision made, however, he acknowledged First Interstate may now have a difficult time keeping its number four position in the California banking community.     "The competition in this state is tough," he said, noting CityBank's recent purchase of 50 financial service branches from Sears Roebuck company. "CityBank is moving rapidly to move us down to fifth and Wells Fargo down to fourth," he said.     Outside California, Pinola acknowledged that Security Pacific Corp, with its recent acquisitions in Arizona, Washington and Oregon, is quickly becoming a regional competitor in areas where First Interstate has long dominated.     "Security is, has been and continues to be a highly profitable and obviously well managed company," he said.     He added, however, First Interstate, at the moment, has the advantages of having owned and managed regional banks longer and has the recognition advantage of having given its regional banks a common name.     Pinola said while its coastal state banks are in good financial condition, First Interstate continues to sustain serious loan losses in its Rocky Mountain states, where energy, real estate and agriculture dominate the economy.     Asked if he thought loan losses in those areas had peaked, he said, "I don't think it has bottomed out, because I think most of the problems are real estate-related and the real estate problems are going to be with us for several years."     Pinola said another failing economic sector, agriculture in the Midwest, has slowed expansion of First Interstate's franchise operation.     First Interstate has 42 franchise banks that offer First Interstate financial services in ten states.     While a year ago he was considering taking his franchise operation east of the Mississippi River, Pinola said because most of the franchise banks are now in the West, expansion into the Midwest must come first.     Calling the franchise system, "moderately profitable," Pinola said, "It is going to take a rejuvenation of the agriculture sector for us to commence franchising at the speed we were generating before the last year or two."     On the banking industry in general, Pinola said he thinks 1987 will be another bad year for loan losses, with only banks with minimal holdings in real estate able to improve profits.  Reuter ;

CFTC Commissioner William Seale said the proposal was a move in the wrong direction. "I would prefer to see (surveillance) paid for through the appropriations process rather than through taxation of market participants," he said.

It estimates that total bulk shipping demand from the iron ore sector will fall by almost 10 pct, or 200 billion tonne miles, with shipping demand associated with the coking trade down about 17 pct or 130 billion tonne miles.     The report sees EC imports falling to 91.7 mln tonnes in 2000 from 123.6 mln in 1985 with Japanese imports falling to 89 mln from 124.6 mln tonnes. Imports to South East Asia are seen rising to 58.6 mln from 32.6 mln tonnes in 1985.

TEST;26-MAR-1987 14:12:28.87;BP<BP> OFFER RAISES EXPECTATIONS FOR OIL VALUES;     By PATTI DOMM, Reuters British Petroleum Plc's plan to pay 7.4 billion dlrs for less than half of Standard Oil Co has signalled higher values in the U.S. oil patch, analysts said.     "I think that BP's bid is a very strong affirmation and clear signal that they have confidence in the U.S., and they think the barrel of oil in the ground is going to go higher," said Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.     BP earlier today said its U.S. unit planned to tender at 70 dlrs per share for the 45 pct of Standard it does not already own.     "It's a 7.4 billion dlr price that (shows) OPEC has won the war and oil prices are not going to crack," said Prescott, Ball and Turben analyst Bruce Lazier.     "Behind that is a huge implication for the rest of the energy issues out there in the stock market, particularly those that are acquisition targets," Lazier said.     One of those mentioned by Lazier was USX Corp, an energy-steel concern which had been courted by investor Carl Icahn and drew the attention of Australian Robert Holmes a Court last year. Rumors continue to swirl around its stock.     Margoshes said he does not foresee major U.S. oil firms falling into takeover situations for several years, with the exception of possibly Amerada Hess Corp <AHC>. He said most of the majors found partners in the last round of matchmaking which ended two years ago, and others restructured to the point that they have become unattractive.     U.S. oil stocks rallied in response to the offer. Exxon Corp <XON> rose 1-1/8 to 88-1/2. Chevron Corp <CHV> jumped 1-1/8 to 58-7/8, and Texaco <TX> climbed 1/4 to 37-3/4. Unocal Corp <UCL> rose 1-3/4, while Occidental Petroleum Corp <OXY> climbed 1-1/8 to 34-3/4. Amoco Corp <AN> rose 1-3/8 to 83-3/4.     Standard Oil's stock was up 6-1/4 in heavy trading to 71-1/8. Earlier in the session it had been at a high of 72-1/4. Wall Street has speculated British Petroleum may boost its offer by several dlrs per share, but the company maintained it would not raise the 70 dlr bid.     British Petroleum stock rose 2-1/4 to 59-5/8.     Analysts said the fact British Petroleum made such a bid in the first place indicates that the British oil giant has changed its outlook for the oil industry.     Analysts said last year British Petroleum held one of the more bearish positions on oil prices.     "They said the real price of oil would stay at 15 dlrs (a barrel) for several years, and I think they beat a hasty retreat from that point of view," Margoshes said.     "They are more appropriately today looking more optimistically. I believe they are looking at 18 dlrs (long-term)...also in their heart of hearts they believe that will be exceeded," Margoshes said.     The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate was trading today around 18.60 dlrs per barrel.     Analysts said British Petroleum might have been able to buy up the rest of Standard Oil for about 50 dlrs per share when oil prices were falling last year.     They said Standard Oil's brightest asset is its slightly more than 50 pct ownership of the Alaskan Prudhoe Bay oil field. Analysts also said the company has other interests in the Alaskan North Slope.     Analysts said the Standard investment is extremely attractive to BP because the U.S. is the largest oil market and has hard-to-replace reserves.     "I think it just fits in with their long-range plans to increase their position in the U.S. market," Dean Witter analyst Eugene Nowak said.     Analysts said it also raises BP's visibility ahead of the British government's announced disposal of 31.7 pct of BP stock. The U.K. government said it would dispose of the holding sometime in the year beginning April one.     After acquiring all of Standard, most of BP's reserves would be in the U.S., but only about six pct of its stock is held in the U.S.     "The only way they can sell all that stock is to move it into the United States. No other market can handle all that stock," said L.F. rothschild analyst Rosario Ilacqua.     In 1986, Standard Oil had net losses of 345 mln dlrs on revenues of 10.02 billion dlrs, compared to a profit the year earlier of 308 mln dlrs on revenues of 13.82 billion dlrs.       Reuter ;

TEST;26-MAR-1987 15:35:19.41;U.K. DEALERS DOUBT HUGE JAPANESE CASH INFLUX;     By Phil Smith, Reuters Many London equity dealers doubt whether the much publicised flood of Japanese investment into the U.K. Equity market will be as large as some analysts have forecast.     There has recently been much speculation that the Japanese would look towards the U.K. Stock market for investment opportunities on a much larger scale when the new fiscal year begins next month. Last October's reorganisation of the stock market, known as 'Big Bang', paved the way for greater participation by overseas investors.     Some analysts believe the Japanese have earmarked massive sums for investment in Europe.     Both the London and Tokyo markets have moved ahead strongly since the start of this year. But London has lagged behind in real terms and therefore is now beginning to look like giving a better return on any funds that are reserved for equity investment. Sterling's firmness also means there are profits to be made from the currency turn. However, many equity dealers polled by Reuters think that the Japanese will shy away from London and continue to invest in instruments such as U.S. Government securities.     Even if they do diversify from their old stamping grounds they will head for the U.S. Equity market before they come to the European stock markets, one dealer predicted.     "The Japanese, although very aggressive in markets that they know, tend to be more conservative in those they don't...Even if they do come to London in a big way they would tend to go more for the fixed interest gilt edged market rather than the more volatile equities," he added.     He also cited the forthcoming U.K. General election as another factor in keeping Far Eastern money out of the London stock market.     "The Japanese do not like too much uncertainty and a general election creates just the kind that will keep them on the sidelines," one trader said.     There are also doubts whether the Japanese would find the track records of U.K. Companies strong enough to make them willing to invest heavily. "Our industrial and manufacturing output may be looking better, but it must still look pretty uninspiring to the Japanese," one broker said.     Some market participants, however, are a little more bullish and do expect more, although not a massive amount, of Far Eastern funds to come to London in the short term.     They point out that capital gains on U.S. Bonds, a market in which the Japanese are traditionally heavy players, have been eroded because of the fall in the U.S. Dollar and this could prompt them to move funds out of the U.S. But even those who are mildly bullish concede that Japanese investors on the London exchange would almost certainly confine themselves to longer term investment in 10 or 15 leading 'blue chip' issues, which may include industrial giants such as ICI, Hanson Trust, British Petroleum, Glaxo and Unilever.     One analyst said he believed if there was such investment in blue chip issues, recently privatised companies such as British Gas and British Telecom could be left out in the cold.     He said that with an election coming up, overseas investors would be worried that a Labour victory would bring a policy of re-nationalisation of such companies. The Labour party has in the past said it would do this.     Some of the recent rise in U.K. Equities has anticipated an increase in Japanese buying in the near future.  Reuter ;
TEST;26-MAR-1987 15:40:09.91;FRANCE WILL FIGHT EC FARM PROPOSALS - MINISTER;  French Agricultural Minister Francois Guillaume warned that France would flatly reject proposed reforms of the European Community, EC, cereals, sugar and oilseeds sectors, which he said would disrupt these markets.     The EC Commission's proposals to shorten the intervention period and lower monthly premiums for cereals and increase the financial burden on the sugar producers will also result in lower real prices for producers, he told farmers here.     "I give you my word that France, while it will not reject technical adjustments or serious discussion, will simply reply in the negative to these bad reforms," Guillaume told the annual conference of the country's major farm union, FNSEA  (Federation Nationale des Syndicats Dexploitants Agricoles).     Community agricultural ministers are due to meet again Monday to try and agree a package of reforms to curb spiralling EC output and fix farm prices for 1987/88.     Relations between the government and farmers have become strained in France in recent months.     There have been sporadic but frequent demonstrations by farmers protesting over sharp falls in meat and pork prices and further cutbacks in Community milk output.     But Guillaume's warning that he would reject reorganisation of the EC cereal and sugar markets -- France being a major producer of both crops -- won him warm applause from the FNSEA's farmers.     His pledge to fight the EC proposals and push for the complete dismantling of the system of cross border taxes designed to smooth out currency differences known as Monetary Compensatory Amounts, MCA's, however, are unlikely to avoid further protests by producers.     Farm leader Raymond Lacombe said the union planned to go ahead with a series of major protests both in France and abroad against the EC Commission's proposals to overhaul the farm sector.     "The Minister's proposals back up our determination to organise union action in the coming weeks," he told reporters, adding that this could also act in Guillaume's favour on a ministerial level.     Guillaume was head of the FNSEA for many years before being appointed farm minister last spring.     Lacombe refused to say whether the farmers felt that Guillaume was doing a good job as farm minister.     There have been certain advances on cutting production costs, reducing fiscal costs and awarding drought aid, but there are still areas where more could be done such as on farmers' indebtedness, he said.     Guillaume told the conference the government will make available 2.4 billion francs (396 mln dlrs) to help producers reduce milk output and to encourage older farmers to retire.     The government has already announced financial aid for the milk sector and it was not clear how much of the package announced today was new aid, Lacombe said.  Reuter ;

TEST;26-MAR-1987 18:33:15.25;FED DATA INDICATE POLICY LIKELY TO STAY ON HOLD;     By Martin Cherrin, Reuters Federal Reserve data released today indicate that there has been no policy change in recent weeks and that none is likely at next week's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, economists said.     "The Fed continues to be accommodative in its provision of reserves, indicating that there has been no policy shift since the beginning of this year," said Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank.     "These numbers and other things suggest the FOMC will not change policy," said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co.     "The Fed is sitting fairly pretty now. There's no real reason for it to change policy," said Joseph Liro of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.     Liro said the economy is showing moderate growth and does not require immediate policy easing and the money aggregates may well end March at the bottom of their target ranges.     All of the economists agreed that the Fed's major concern now is recent weakness in the dollar which early this week was heavily supported by central banks. They said fear of hurting the dollar will cause the Fed to be cautious in lowering interest rates further.     Numbers released by the Fed today were all in line with expectations and similar to the data for most of this year.     The Fed said that banks' net free reserves averaged 603 mln dlrs in the two-week statement period that ended on Wednesday versus 749 mln dlrs in the previous period.     In the single week to Wednesday, banks' borrowings at the discount window, less extended credits, averaged 302 mln dlrs compared with 228 mln dlrs in the first week of the statement period. Meanwhile the Federal funds rate average edged up to 6.14 pct from 6.08 pct.     The Fed's failure to add reserves in the market on Tuesday and Wednesday surprised some, but economists said the data released today suggest it had no real need to add reserves.     The Fed's absence may be explained by the lack of any pressing need for it to supply reserves and by a desire to boost borrowings in the second week of the statement period to meet its borrowings target, said Liro of Warburg.     Liro said the Fed probably is shooting for a two-week borrowings average of 300-325 mln dlrs. The borrowings actually averaged 265 mln dlrs in the latest statement period and that was up from 191 mln dlrs in the prior period.     Brusca of Nikko agreed that the Fed probably is aiming for two-week average discount window borrowings of around 300 mln dlrs. He said that would correspond to a Federal funds rate of around 6.10 pct.     It is nearly impossible for the Fed to hit any borrowings target since the demand for excess reserves is erratic, said Wells Fargo's Nathan. He said the Fed is focusing instead on the funds rate and is trying to keep it roughly within a six to 6-1/4 pct band.     Upward funds rate pressure and a big reserve-adding need are anticipated for the statement period that began today.  More     Brusca believes the Fed will have to add 3.5 to four billion dlrs a day in reserves in this statement period. Liro puts the add need at around 3.9 billion dlrs.     To partly address this requirement, many expect the Fed to add permanent reserves with effect next Thursday by offering to buy all maturities of Treasury bills on Wednesday. A similar coupon "pass" may be required later.     There will be a greater demand for funds in this statement period because it includes the close of the quarter. Further upward pressure on the Federal funds rate may come from window dressing demand as the Japanese fiscal year ends on March 31.  Reuter ;

TEST;27-MAR-1987 03:44:57.62T C;PHILIPPINE SUGAR CROP SET AT 1.6 MLN TONNES;     By Chaitanya Kalbag, Reuters Philippine sugar production in the 1987/88 crop year ending August has been set at 1.6 mln tonnes, up from a provisional 1.3 mln tonnes this year, Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA) chairman Arsenio Yulo said.     Yulo told Reuters a survey during the current milling season, which ends next month, showed the 1986/87 estimate would almost certainly be met.     He said at least 1.2 mln tonnes of the 1987/88 crop would be earmarked for domestic consumption.     Yulo said about 130,000 tonnes would be set aside for the U.S. Sugar quota, 150,000 tonnes for strategic reserves and 50,000 tonnes would be sold on the world market.     He said if the government approved a long-standing SRA recommendation to manufacture ethanol, the project would take up another 150,000 tonnes, slightly raising the target.     "The government, for its own reasons, has been delaying approval of the project, but we expect it to come through by July," Yulo said.     Ethanol could make up five pct of gasoline, cutting the oil import bill by about 300 mln pesos.     Yulo said three major Philippine distilleries were ready to start manufacturing ethanol if the project was approved.     The ethanol project would result in employment for about 100,000 people, sharply reducing those thrown out of work by depressed world sugar prices and a moribund domestic industry.     Production quotas, set for the first time in 1987/88, had been submitted to President Corazon Aquino.     "I think the President would rather wait till the new Congress convenes after the May elections," he said. "But there is really no need for such quotas. We are right now producing just slightly over our own consumption level."     "The producers have never enjoyed such high prices," Yulo said, adding sugar was currently selling locally for 320 pesos per picul, up from 190 pesos last August.     Yulo said prices were driven up because of speculation following the SRA's bid to control production.     "We are no longer concerned so much with the world market," he said, adding producers in the Negros region had learned from their mistakes and diversified into corn and prawn farming and cloth production.     He said diversification into products other than ethanol was also possible within the sugar industry.     "The Brazilians long ago learnt their lessons," Yulo said. "They have 300 sugar mills, compared with our 41, but they relocated many of them and diversified production. We want to call this a 'sugarcane industry' instead of the sugar industry."     He said sugarcane could be fed to pigs and livestock, used for thatching roofs, or used in room panelling.     "When you cut sugarcane you don't even have to produce sugar," he said.     Yulo said the Philippines was lobbying for a renewal of the International Sugar Agreement, which expired in 1984.     "As a major sugar producer we are urging them to write a new agreement which would revive world prices," Yulo said.     "If there is no agreement world prices will always be depressed, particularly because the European Community is subsidising its producers and dumping sugar on the markets."     He said current world prices, holding steady at about 7.60 cents per pound, were uneconomical for the Philippines, where production costs ranged from 12 to 14 cents a pound.     "If the price holds steady for a while at 7.60 cents I expect the level to rise to about 11 cents a pound by the end of this year," he said.     Yulo said economists forecast a bullish sugar market by 1990, with world consumption outstripping production.     He said sugar markets were holding up despite encroachments from artificial sweeteners and high-fructose corn syrup.     "But we are not happy with the Reagan Administration," he said. "Since 1935 we have been regular suppliers of sugar to the U.S. In 1982, when they restored the quota system, they cut ours in half without any justification."     Manila was keenly watching Washington's moves to cut domestic support prices to 12 cents a pound from 18 cents.     The U.S. Agriculture Department last December slashed its 12 month 1987 sugar import quota from the Philippines to 143,780 short tons from 231,660 short tons in 1986.     Yulo said despite next year's increased production target, some Philippine mills were expected to shut down.     "At least four of the 41 mills were not working during the 1986/87 season," he said. "We expect two or three more to follow suit during the next season."  REUTER ;

TEST;27-MAR-1987 07:02:05.60F;GERMAN STOCKS SYSTEM SHOULD DEVELOP ALONGSIDE CITY;  The German auction system of shares trading, retaining the business floor, can develop in parallel to off-floor computer trading introduced in London in the "Big Bang," Frankfurt stock exchange president Michael Hauck said.     Hauck told a conference that it was unclear if the Frankfurt floor would become superfluous. The Frankfurt exchange did 55 pct of all German securities trading and was investing 86 mln marks in renovating its building. A screen-delivered in-house quotation system would soon be in place too.     The nature of the auction system limited how far trading hours could be extended from the present two-hour session.     Other practical problems inhibited the German ability to follow London's moves. Official brokers, who set the prices, were under the control of the Finance Ministry. This meant transfer of securities control to an independent body, if desired, would need legislative changes, Hauck said.     "Shorting" stocks in Germany was also prohibited by the rules for pension and insurance funds. They could thus not be lent out for the kind of speculative positions taken by London market makers.     But Hauck said the system in London could be criticised for being too distant from those it should serve.  REUTER ;

TEST;27-MAR-1987 08:13:21.80A;INDIA STEPS UP COUNTERTRADE DEALS TO CUT TRADE GAP;     By Ajoy Sen, Reuters India is searching for non-communist countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and conserve foreign exchange.     Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products, chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters.     Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in 1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC).     "The two state trading corporations are free to use their buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian exports," a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that private firms are excluded from countertrading.     One trade source said India has targetted countries that depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign imports.     However, countertrade deals still make up only a small part of India's total trading and are likely to account for less than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade during the nine months ended December, the sources said.     Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65 billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March, against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show.     However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said.     Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude oil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87, against three billion in 1985/86.     Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to help narrow the country's large trade deficit, is still insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia, Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said.     The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96 billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billion in the current fiscal year.     But the push to include non-communist countries in countertrade is also due to other factors, including the slow growth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule, shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said.     One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting countertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were made discreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannot officially support bartering.     The MMTC's recent countertrade deals include iron ore exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails.     "MMTC's recent global tenders now include a clause that preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind for goods and services sold to India," a trade official said, adding that the policy remains flexible.     "We also take into account other factors such as prices at which the goods and services are offered to India," the trade official said.     Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign companies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigs and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance if they bought Indian goods or services in return, the trade sources said.     Illustrating the point, the official said a South Korean firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln dlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission.  Reuter ;

Although the recent fall in inflation was "largely attributable to purely statistical factors," the decline had clearly been aided by a recovery in the rand's exchange rate, the Bank said.     "The inflation rate stands to benefit further from the more recent advances in the exchange rate in the third quarter of 1986 and in the first few months of 1987," it said.  REUTER ;

Nelson Bunker, W. Herbert and Lamar Hunt sued the 23 banks last year for 13.8 billion dlrs in damages after halting payment to the banks on 1.5 billon dlrs in overdue loans to <Placid Oil Co> and <Penrod Drilling Co>.     The ruling announced Thursday by Judge Barefoot Sanders clears the way for the Hunts to examine documents and interview officers at the banks seeking evidence to support their charges of fraud, breach of fiduciary duty and interfering with the companies ability to pay back the loans.     Judge Sanders also rejected parts of the Unts' suit, including allegations the banks were trying to monopolize the drilling-rig business.

As a result, the company retroactively charged all past exploration and related administration costs incurred on its properties against expenses in 1986, 1985 and 1984.     Under the new policy, all future exploration and related administration costs will be written off to expenses rather than capitalized as an intangible asset, it said.     Galactic said the accounting change resulted in a 22.8 mln U.S. dlr charge against 1986 earnings. It did not immediately disclose the affect of the change on prior years' results.     The new accounting policy is not expected to adversely affect working capital position, future cash flows or the company's ability to conduct ongoing business operations, it said.     Galactic said the charge includes 9.9 mln U.S. dlrs of costs concerning its Summitville Mine leach pad and 8.9 mln U.S. dlrs in waste removal costs, dyke construction and other mine developments.     Galactic said under the prior accounting policy, the Summitville mine expenses would have been amortized over the life of the mine and charged against future earnings.     The change will also result in lower depreciation and amortization charges against income of about 52 U.S. dlrs an ounce of gold produced in future periods, based on total estimated reserves of 617,000 ounces.     Galactic said March leaching production at Summitville is expected to exceed 2,500 ounces, raising gold equivalent production since the June 5, 1986 start of leaching to 65,000 ounces.  Reuter ;

Honeywell said it will use much of the money to reduce short-term debt incurred last December when the company purchased the Sperry Aerospace Group.     Honeywell said the sale of HIS has created a new dedicated computer company jointly owned by Bull, NEC and Honeywell.     The new privately held company, named Honeywell Bull, is 42.5 pct owned by Honeywell Inc, 42.5 pct by Bull and 15 pct by NEC, the new company said.     Honeywell added that terms of the agreement with NEC and Bull allow it to reduce its current 42.5 pct stake in the new company to 19.9 pct at the end of 1988 by selling just over half its shares to Bull. Book value at the time will determine the move's pricing, Honeywell said.     Honeywell chairman and chief executive officer, Edson Spencer, said the move is the last major step in Honeywell's restructuring.     "As the leading worldwide supplier of of automation and controls for buildings, industry, aerospace and defense, Honeywell is now focusing its management, technical and financial resources on high market share business," Spencer said.     Honeywell said it expects to be Honeywell Bull's largest customer, purchasing computers for its own internal data processing, for integration into Honeywell buidling and industrial automation systems and for resale to the U.S. governement.     Honeywell said HIS's Federal Systems Division is now a wholly owned unit of Honeywell Inc, and has been named Honeywell Federal Systems Inc.     Honeywell said it accounted for HIS as a discontinued operation in 1986, and will account for its future interest on a cost basis, recording any dividends as received.     Honeywell Bull said it will continue to develop its product line and build its business in integrated systems for networking, database management and transaction processing.     The new company said its board will have nine members, including the chairman and chief executive officer.     Bull will have four members, Honeywell two and NEC one, the new company, which began worldwide operations today, said.     It added that Jacques Stern, Bull's chairman and chief executive officer, will serve as Honeywell Bull's chairman of the board, while Jerome Meyer, formerly executive vice president of Honeywell Information Systems, was named president and chief executive officer.

Bouldikian told an Arab exchange dealers conference the bank would continue to take measures to defend the currency.     But he said Lebanon needed foreign support for its war-battered economy now more than ever before. "We expect a common effort between the central bank and Arab central banks and monetary authorities to create an Arab fund to support and preserve the value of the currency when needed," he said.     Twelve years of civil war have devastated productive sectors of the Lebanese economy and created gaping trade and budget deficits.     Bouldikian said recent government measures had succeeded in reducing demand for imports and increasing exports. "These are encouraging factors, but the war has not ended yet," he said.     "We believe that with a just political solution acceptable to all sides, confidence will return and this will benefit the Lebanese pound and Lebanon."     In the meantime, he said the central bank had four main goals:     1) to use surplus liquidity to finance the budget deficit     2) to increase the role of commercial banks and non-bank financing institutions in financing the deficit     3) to limit the transfer of Lebanese pounds into foreign currency deposits     4) to protect the financial health of commercial banks.

A Foreign Ministry statement last night hinted Turkey was claiming victory. A Greek-based international consortium, North Aegean Petroleum Co., Had given up plans to start searching for oil in international waters east of Thasos island, it said.     "In the same way it has been understood that Greece will also not undertake oil activities outside its territorial waters," the statement added.     An Ankara Radio report monitored in London said Foreign Minister Vahit Halefolu had called on Greece to engage in dialogue over the dispute. It was impossible to resolve the dispute by crises, he was quoted as saying.     "We call on Greece to come and engage in a dialogue with us - let us find a solution as two neighbours and allies should," he said.     The radio said Halefoglu had briefed the leaders of a number of the country"s political parties on the latest developments.     Turkey sent the survey ship Sismik 1 into the Aegean yesterday, flanked by warships, to press its case but having earlier said it would go into disputed waters, declared the vessel would stay in Turkish areas.     Prime Minister Turgut Ozal, in London on his way home after heart surgery in the United States, is expected to receive an ecstatic welcome from thousands of Turks when he returns today.     He was in defiant mood last night, telling Turkish radio: "We can never accept that Greece should confine us to the Anatolian continent. If there are riches under the sea, they are for mankind."     Despite the end of the crisis, Turkish officials acknowledged that the underlying dispute over delimiting the continental shelf in the Aegean remained unsolved.     Turkey alleged that the consortium"s plans would have infringed the 1976 Berne agreement between the two countries, which called for a moratorium on any activities until the delimitation was agreed. Greece earlier this month declared it considers the accord inoperative.  REUTER ;
TEST;28-MAR-1987 23:19:43.36;GREECE SCRAPS U.S. BASE CLOSURE REQUEST;  Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou has withdrawn a request to Washington to suspend operations at an American army base near Athens as a Greek-Turkish row over oil rights in the Aegean eased.     A Turkish research ship which Greece had threatened to tackle if it sailed into disputed waters in the Aegean Sea kept to Turkish territorial waters yesterday, avoiding a potential clash.     Papandreou expressed qualified optimism after briefing opposition leaders on Aegean developments early yesterday.     The Greek government later withdrew Friday's request to Washington to close down its telecommunications base at Nea Makri, north of Athens, saying that the reasons which had prompted it to make the request were no longer valid.     Under the terms of the U.S.-Greek bases accord, Greece has the right to ask for suspension of operations at times when its national interests are threatened.     The row in the Aegean erupted after Turkey said it would search for oil round three Greek islands off its coast following an announcement from Greece that it planned to drill east of Thassos island after taking control of a Canadian-led oil consortium operating in the northern Aegean.     Turkey accused Greece of breaching the 1976 Berne Agreement under which both sides agreed to preserve the status quo in the Aegean until their continental shelf dispute was settled. Athens says it considers the accord inactive.     The Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement it had received an assurance from Greece that it would not carry out oil activities outside its territorial waters. Greece declined comment on the statement.     Papandreou repeated an invitation to Turkey to take the long-standing continental shelf dispute to the International Court of Justice at The Hague.     Conservative opposition leader Constantine Mitsotakis said he had urged Papandreou to accept an offer from NATO General Secretary Lord Carrington to help resolve the row.  REUTER ;

"Due to a general recession in the world economy, the demand for development funds was low and there was a scarcity of processable projects in most member countries during 1406 (September 1985-86)," the report said.     It said a steep decline in oil prices had led to a major transfer of resources from oil-producing countries to industrial nations.     "The oil exporting member nations of the IDB faced a major adjustment problem arising from a sizable decline in oil prices and loss of export earnings, affecting their position as potential suppliers of capital," the report said.     Project financing and technical assistance loans fell to 175.7 mln Islamic dinars in the year ended last September from 269.4 mln the previous year.     The report said although there was a reduction in foreign trade financing loans in the past year due to a sharp decline in the price of oil and various primary commodities, the quantity financed in physical terms of imports was higher.     Foreign Trade financing declined to 572.8 mln dinars from 668.2 million dinars the previous year. Disbursements of loans, including previously-approved loans, fell to 557.2 mln dinars from 783.9 mln.     The Bank in 1986 decided to establish a fund under the name "IDB Unit Trust" to introduce and market financial instruments in line with the principles of Islam, the report said.     "This experience will provide a foundation for the floating of other financial instruments in the near future through which the bank expects to mobilise even larger resources," the report said.     The IDB was established by the 46-member Islamic Conference Organisation and opened in October 1975.  REUTER ;

TEST;30-MAR-1987 03:45:19.60;BAHRAIN INTRODUCES NEW MONEY MARKET REGIME;  Bahrain is introducing a new domestic money market regime to provide dinar liquidity aid centred on the island's newly launched treasury bill programme.     The Bahrain Monetary Agency has issued a circular to all commercial banks outlining a new policy from April 1 which gives liquidity aid through sale and repurchase agreements in treasury bills, or through discounting them.     The circular, released officially to Reuters, said current arrangements for providing liquidity aid will no longer be valid except "in quite exceptional circumstances."     Under the current system, the agency provides the island's 20 commercial banks with dinar liquidity by means of short-term swaps against U.S. Dollars and, less frequently, by short-term loans secured against government development bonds.     "The agency considers that it is now appropriate to replace these operations with short-term assistance based on Government of Bahrain treasury bills," the circular to banks states.     The agency said it will repurchase treasury bills with a simultaneous agreement to resell them to the same bank at a higher price which will reflect an interest charge.     The agency said it envisages the repurchase agreements will normally be for a period of seven days.     Bahrain launched a weekly tender for two mln dinars of 91-day treasury bills in mid-December last year and has since raised a total of 26 mln dinars through the programme.     Bahrain's commercial banks are currently liquid and have been making little use of the traditional dollar swaps offered by the agency. But banking sources said the new regime from April 1 will mean banks cannot afford not to hold treasury bills in case they need funds from the central bank.     Banking sources said more than half of the 20 banks hold treasury bills, although the need by others to take up paper could increase demand at weekly tenders and push down allotted yields slightly.     Last week's yield was six pct, although the programme had started at the end of last year with rates as low as 5.60 pct.     Banking sources said the cost of liquidity through repurchase accords will not differ much from that on dollar swaps. But a bank using dollars to obtain liquidity would foresake interest on the U.S. Currency while the underlying treasury bill investment is unaffected in a repurchase accord.  REUTER ;

The bill, to mature on May 2, will produce a 3.8995 pct yield on the sales, made by the Bank of Japan to banks and seucurities houses through money houses, they said.     The repurchase agreement yield compares with the 3.9375 pct one-month commercial bill discount rate today and the 4.40 pct rate on one-month certificates of deposit.     The surplus is due largely to government tax allocations to local governments and public entities at the end of fiscal 1986/87 tomorrow.

In a statement following the release of its 1986 results, IT stated that the current year had started well. It reported that pretax profits in the year rose to 35.46 mln stg from 21.84 mln previously on turnover higher at 313.3 mln after 252.2 mln.     The strong recovery of the first six months continued into the second half, although U.K. Cement demand rose only modestly. Results benefitted from cost cutting and higher volumes.     The decision by the Cement Makers Federation to end the pricing agreement reflected pressure from higher competition due to growing imports and the possibility that the system would be taken to the Restrictive Practices Court by the U.K. Government. It stated that its John Carr unit benefitted from strong organic growth, although overseas its Cockburn operation had a difficult period with high maintenance costs and increased depreciation charges.     The company is proposing to change its name at the next annual meeting to <Rugby Group Plc>.     Rugby said it spent 27 mln stg on acquisitions in 1986. It noted that its Western Australia hotels company had agreed to sell the Parmelia hotel for 31.5 mln Australian dlrs, some seven mln stg above end-1986 book value.

TEST;30-MAR-1987 08:34:27.30;ONGPIN SAYS "PINS" WILL REVIVE BAKER PLAN;  Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin said Philippine Investment Notes (PINs), to be offered to commercial bank creditors as part of the country's 13.2 billion dlr debt rescheduling, would revive the Baker Plan.     PINs are tradable, foreign currency-denominated financial instruments with a six-year maturity, designed for conversion into pesos to fund government-approved equity investments within the Philippines.     Ongpin told reporters after a meeting with businessmen the government was planning to issue between 100 and 150 mln dlrs worth of PINs at a discount of about 12.5 pct this year.     The plan, outlined by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker 18 months ago, stalled because commercial banks balked at the idea of lending additional money, Ongpin said. It had called for substantial new commercial bank lending and development bank aid in order to help debtor countries grow out of their economic troubles.     The PINs provide a mechanism to finance the growth needed by these debtor nations, provided they are willing to welcome foreign equity investment into their economies, Ongpin told a businessmen's meeting. "And this can now be achieved without forcing commercial banks into involuntary new money lending."     Bankers in New York said given the booming market in debt-equity swaps, PINs ought to work if Manila issues the notes at an appropriate discount.     Ongpin said the use of PINs would result in anticipated savings of one billion pesos over the debt agreement's 17-year life.     The accord restructured 5.8 billion dlrs of previously rescheduled debt, 3.5 billion dlrs of debt falling due between January 1987 and December 1992, and 925 mln dlrs of new money lent by the banks in 1985 at a spread of 7/8 percentage points over London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR).     It also rolled over trade credits worth 2.9 billion dlrs.     Ongpin said the Philippines' 7-1/2 year grace period was better than Mexico's seven-year grace period, while the PINs proposal would result in savings of foreign exchange and generate pesos which would be reinvested in domestic enterprises.     Ongpin said the restructuring of commercial bank debt, as well as of 870 mln dlrs of debt by the Paris Club of Western creditor governments in January, was expected to reduce the country's debt-service ratio to between 25 and 30 pct from its current level of 40 to 45 pct.     He said the country's balance of payments was now projected at a surplus of about 1.2 billion dlrs in 1987, compared with a surplus of about 1.1 billion dlrs in 1986 and a previous projected deficit of 1.2 billion dlrs this year.     The Philippine negotiating team refined the PINs idea three times before the final agreement was struck last Friday, Ongpin said. "What we have now is PINs IV," he said.     Ongpin told the meeting he had kept his promise to gain terms better than those granted last year to Mexico, which won a 20-year repayment at 13/16 points over LIBOR.     "And they (Mexico) are a long way from seeing any money cross the table even as of today," Ongpin said, adding he expected much quicker approval from all the Philippines' 483 creditor banks worldwide.     He said he had been in almost daily telephone contact with President Corazon Aquino, particularly when the banks began to take a very tough stance on pricing.     "But the President's instructions were unequivocal and unwavering, 'Do not yield one more millimetre and I don't care how long it takes. Get a green card if you have to, but don't come home without a deal we can all be proud of'," he said.  REUTER ;

TEST;30-MAR-1987 11:11:43.71;SRI LANKA APPEALS FOR DROUGHT RELIEF AID;  Sri Lanka has appealed to 24 countries for emergency aid to help 2.4 mln villagers affected by the country's worst drought in 36 years, government officials said.     Embassies received letters over the weekend outlining aid needed for a sixth of Sri Lanka's population in 13 districts.     The letter said the government had to step in "to avert serious economic hardship" and because the Social Services Ministry had already used up its entire 1987 budget provision of 23 mln rupees by distributing help to the worst hit areas.     The letter said 548.76 mln rupees were needed for a six month period, at least until the May-September (Yala) rice crop was harvested. Over 25,000 tonnes of wheat, rice, flour and other cereals were required, it said, along with supplies of sugar, lentils, dried or canned fish and milk.     In some of the most seriously affected districts, the Maha (October 1986-April 1987) crop had been "almost completely devastated," the letter said. Maha paddy output was now estimated at 70 mln bushels, 20 mln less than originally expected.     There were two scenarios for the Yala crop, with a high forecast of around 40 mln bushels conditional on adequate rainfall within the next three to four weeks.     "Should the present drought continue, however, production is estimated at around 20 mln bushels," the letter added.     Total estimated paddy output for 1987 would be between 90 and 110 mln bushels, or 1.35 to 1.65 mln tonnes of rice. Last year's output was 124 mln bushels, down from 127 mln in 1985.     The letter said villagers in most seriously affected districts had been deprived of any means of subsistence because subsidiary crops had also failed.     It said the government's current budget did not permit it to provide sustained and adequate relief to those affected. "Revenue has been adversely affected by depressed commodity prices and slowing of the economy. Defence commitments continue to exert pressure on the expenditure side."     The 548.76 mln cash would cover payments of 150 rupees per month for each family, as well as handling, transport and distribution of emergency food. But such an outlay of funds by the government would not be possible without seriously impairing development projects, or "greatly fuelling inflation" in the economy, the letter said.     The letter said the Food Department would be able to release wheat and rice from the buffer stock to meet the immediate cereal requirements "provided such stocks are replaced subsequently."     The Meteorological Department said the country was experiencing its worst drought since 1951 and the four-month dry spell prevailing in most of the areas would only break when the monsoon rains fell in late May.     The letter said some areas had been experiencing the drought since August, and in the rice growing district of Kurunegala there had been no effective rainfall since June 1986.  Reuter ;

He owned the Home State Savings Bank of Cincinnati at the time of its March 9, 1985, collapse following more than 143 mln dlrs in loses.     Warner and two other bank officials were charged with 82 counts of misapplying the bank's funds by transferring them to ESM Government Securities Inc., of Florida without the authorization of the bank's board.     ESM collapsed in March of 1985, taking Home State -- its biggest investor -- down with it.     Home State's failure wiped out the reserves of its insurer, the Ohio Deposit Guarantee Fund, a state regulated institution that was not federally insured. That prompted a run on dozens of other savings and loan associations across the state which were insured by the same fund, forcing some of them to close until they obtained federal deposit insurance.

Thompson, commenting in the annual report, said the mining industry remained "cynical" about whether Pretoria really intends to remove barriers which prevent blacks from holding skilled jobs.     He urged the government to back up pledges by introducing a bill when parliament reconvenes later this year.     The vast majority of South Africa's 600,000 miners are black but whites perform most supervisory jobs.     The government has vowed to open all mining jobs to all races this year but the mining industry fears clauses inserted in an abolition bill could be used to make it difficult for blacks to qualify for skilled positions.     "The reluctance of the government to repeal (discriminatory provisions) obstructs the advancement of blacks and denies them opportunities for taking increasing responsibilities," Thompson said.

Among the best performers was steel company Sidor which earned 1.019 billion bolivars, the first time since 1978 Sidor turned a profit.     The gain was made possible in part by the refinancing of 1.619 mln dollars of foreign debt.     CVG's three aluminum companies also showed substantial gains. Interalumina, which makes the intermediate material alumina, had an increase in profits from 116 to 217 mln bolivars, Alcasa earned 487 mln bolivars, as compared to 1985's 412 mln and Venalum's profits rose by around half, from 1.042 to 1.504 bln bolivars.

Argentina is pressing for a margin of 13/16 pct over the London Interbank Offered Rate, the same rate as on Mexico's recent new-loan and rescheduling package, but the banks are refusing, they said.     Negotiations continued in New York today, even though Finance Secretary Mario Brodersohn has returned to Argentina to consult president Raul Alfonsin on the proposed terms.     After the difficulty of syndicating Mexico's 7.7 billion dlr loan, bankers feel that they could not sell a package for Argentina with a margin of 13/16 pct. They are holding out for a spread close to one pct, with 7/8 pct - the rate won by Venezuela and the Philippines - as their rock-bottom offer.     "What they're looking at and what we've got on the table are not that far apart," one banker said.     Bankers said that Argentina is seeking to stretch out principal repayments on upcoming public-sector debt maturities for 19 years and is looking for a 13-year loan from the banks to cover the bulk of its 2.15 billion dlr new-money need.

The company's shares were quoted at 372p at 0915 GMT compared with 364p last night.     The dealers said the speculation appeared to originate in Japan.

TEST;31-MAR-1987 05:36:41.59;INDIA EXPORTS ITS FIRST PASSENGER CARS;  India today signed an agreement to sell 500 mini passenger cars to Hungary, its first export contract for cars, an industry ministry spokesman told Reuters.     Under the agreement signed between Maruti Udyog Ltd (MUL) - an Indo-Japanese car maker - and Hungary's state-owned Mogurt trading company - the cars, valued about two mln dlrs, will be delivered in 1987, he said.     "We expect Hungary will buy up to 5,000 Maruti cars per year from next year if the first batch proves popular in that country," he said without elaborating.     The launching of 800 cc Maruti cars in 1983 revolutionised the country's dormant automobile industry, which until then had marketed models which were at least 30 years old.     The Indian government owns 74 pct stake in MUL, and the balance of 26 pct is held by Suzuki Motor Co Ltd of Japan.     The Japanese-style Maruti, costing about 81,000 rupees, is the cheapest car on the Indian market and has proved a popular model, with order books full for the next three years, industry sources said.     MUL and India's three private companies have a combined production capacity of 206,000 passenger cars a year.  REUTER ;

TEST;31-MAR-1987 06:56:30.47;LASMO SET TO BENEFIT FROM FUTURE OIL PRICE RISES;  London and Scottish Marine Oil Plc (Lasmo) <LASL.L> will have an advantage when oil prices rise again and it is confident this will happen early in the next decade, the company said in a statement accompanying results.     Lasmo said its advantage comes from its reserves of oil and gas which at the end of 1986 stood at 210 mln barrels of oil equivalent, a group record. Reserves have increased every year since 1983 at a compounded rate of 10 pct a year.     The company reported a 1986 pretax profit of 4.4 mln stg, down from 118 mln in 1985.     It said falling oil prices caused the downturn.     The company said it reacted swiftly to the sharp drop in oil prices which began over a year ago. Capital expenditure, which had been budgeted at over 150 mln stg, was cut to 51 mln stg net of disposals. Managers responded well to the demand for lower operating costs and this has been achieved worldwide.     The company said had very few exploration wells committed for 1987 and therefore retains maximum flexibility in its exploration program. Even without further success, the existing fields and recent discoveries will contribute significantly to profit and cash flow for some years to come, it said.     Lasmo shares were down 2p at 251 after the announcement.  REUTER ;

TEST;31-MAR-1987 07:06:42.67;CALL MONEY PRESSURE FROM LARGE GERMAN BANKS;     By Allan Saunderson, Reuters One or two large West German banks effectively drained the domestic money market of liquidity at the end of the month in order to achieve higher rates from their overnight deposits, money dealers said.     As a result, call money soared in active trading to around the Lombard rate of five pct from 3.70/80 pct yesterday as banks found themselves short of minimum reserve funds.     Bundesbank figures showed that banks held an average daily 51 billion marks in interest-free minimum reserve assets at the central bank over the first 29 days of the month.     Though this was above the March requirement of 50.7 billion, actual holdings at the weekend were 44.2 billion.     To meet the daily average, dealers said, banks must raise holdings by two billion marks to 46.3 billion today and tomorrow. But liquidity was tight in early business because banks excessively took up the Bundesbank's offer for sale of Treasury bills on Friday. This provides a rate of 3.50 pct for three-day deposits and is an effective floor to the market.     Though some liquidity, from bills bought on Thursday, flowed back into the market today, the bulk would not return until tomorrow, the start of the new month, dealers said.     Dealers said the large banks, which they did not name, commanded short-term money requirements of as much as five billion marks or so.     With a knowledge of their own needs until the end of the month, the banks bought excessive amounts of treasury bills, draining liquidity for three days. When other banks sought funds, rates rose and large banks were able to place excess funds on deposit at a considerably higher average return.     One senior dealer said the Bundesbank, with advanced knowledge of the market's needs, should have curtailed its sales of treasury bills on Friday.     Though dealers only late in the day learn of the total minimum reserve holdings of the previous day, the Bundesbank has an immediate overview of the situation and could anticipate the strength of demand for funds the following day, he said.     "(Bundesbank dealers) could easily have said we are not selling any treasury bills or we're not selling them in this amount," he said. "If the Bundesbank wants to finely steer the market then they should avoid such excesses. Tomorrow it will be different. Call money will fall back to 4.0 pct or so."     But the Bundesbank would not approve of the sharp jump in rates, given the delicate state of currency markets.     International central banks have been at pains to prevent a dollar fall against major currencies, including the mark. Dealers said a rise in call money gives the mark a firmer undertone, contributing to downward pressure on the dollar.     "The whole tender policy is to have a call money of between three and four pct. In that case the excesses as we have today cannot be very popular," the senior dealer said.     Dealers said the large banks probably achieved average rates of return on their excess funds of between 3.75 pct or four pct. This is a higher return than they would have earned without the excessive draining through the treasury bill mechanism.     Because of the currency situation and the wage negotiations between Germany's major employers and the unions, the Bundesbank would be very unlikely to make any changes to monetary policy at its council meeting on Thursday, they said.     Bundesbank figures showed that banks fell back on the Lombard emergency funding facility to draw down 1.5 billion marks yesterday as rates began to tighten in late business.  REUTER ;

He said the FCL offer was better than Amcor's because it would have been made to all NZFP shareholders, but he gave no further details.     Amcor and NZFP said earlier today they were merging their pulp and paper interests in a joint partnership and were increasing their existing cross-shareholdings.     The plan involves NZFP increasing its current holding in Amcor to about 20 pct from four pct. Amcor will acquire Rada's NZFP stake to add to its existing 11 pct and will seek statutory approval to increase its holding to 50 pct.     Rada bought its stake for 505.5 mln dlrs from <Wattie Industries Ltd> last year, but it has not disclosed the price to be paid by Amcor.     FCL originally launched a takeover bid for NZFP late last year with a scrip and/or cash offer at 3.90 dlrs a share, valuing the company at 1.3 billion dlrs. NZFP shares ended at 3.88 dlrs today.

He told a Lower House budget committee the government is likely to consider a supplementary budget for fiscal 1987 and a new policy for the ceiling on budgetary requests by government agencies and ministries for 1988/89.     The government had cut budgetary requests in the past five years in line with Nakasone's fiscal reconstruction policy of stopping the issue of deficit-covering bonds by fiscal 1990.     The passage of the budget is expected in late May.     Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said in the same session Japan should use fiscal funds as much as possible to meet domestic and foreign demands for greater domestic growth.     Miyazawa said it appears difficult for the government to stop the deficit-financing bond issues by the targetted time.

TEST;31-MAR-1987 09:57:54.20;EUROTUNNEL NEEDS CAPITAL INCREASE BY END JULY, BENARD SAYS;     By Brian Childs, Reuters French channel tunnel consortium, needs to launch its planned 7.7-billion franc third stage capital increase by end July to cover ongoing project costs, French co-chairman Andre Benard said today.     If the proposed public share offering was delayed beyond then, Eurotunnel would have to find bridging finance, he told reporters during a visit by French parliamentarians to the construction site of the French tunnel terminal.     Early elections in Britain could cause such a delay, he noted.     Britain's lower house of Parliament last month passed a bill endorsing the construction of the 50-km (31-mile) tunnel. The bill still needs approval of the upper house of Lords.     Benard said the consortium had decided after lengthy discussion to issue an identical mix of securities in the London and Paris markets, but details of the precise package had still to be decided.     The offering would comprise approximately three billion francs in each market with another 1.5 billion offered in the United States, Japan and other European markets. Timing will be set to take account of the French privatisation program.    Earlier this month a Eurotunnel official said the ratification bill should go before the National Assembly (lower house) early next month before passing to the Senate (upper house) at the end of May.     Eurotunnel officials expect work on the sites to start in December or January. The tunnel should be completed by 1993 for an overall cost of 50 billion francs.  REUTER ;

TEST;31-MAR-1987 11:17:35.89;WEATHER HURTING YUGOSLAV WHEAT - USDA REPORT;  Unfavorable late winter weather conditions in the main wheat growing areas of Yugoslavia indicate dimmed prospects for the emerging winter wheat crop, the U.S. embassy's agricultural officer in Belgrade said.     The officer, who travelled through an area from Belgrade to Subotica, said in a field report dated March 27 the wheat crop had been set back at least three weeks because of a cold spell that followed a period of warm weather.     He said unseasonably warm weather in late February that brought the wheat crop out of winter dormancy early was followed by three weeks of unusually cold weather.     Damaging effects were seen in the fields, most of which show stands with a yellow-brown cast indicating extensive leaf and possible root damage from repeated freezings, he said.     The report said that since much of the early growth in February was from late seeding rather than from normal development, his view was that the damage may be more extensive than some local observers say.     The most seriously affected fields were late-seeded fields on normal maize soils. Stands in these fields were thin and chances of recovery appeared less favorable, he said.     However, he said soil moisture conditions were favorable and many of the fields had already been top-dressed, which would aid recovery.  Reuter ;

The NRC noted that one Peach Bottom unit is shut down for refuling and said the other must be brought to cold shutdown within 36 hours. Neither unit may be restarted without the commission's approval, the regulatory body said.     The NRC said it received information on March 24 that control room operators at Peach Bottom had been observed sleeping while on duty in the control room.     It said the information indicated this conduct was pervasive and has been occurring for some time, and that shift supervision had knowledge of this situation.     In response to this information, the regulators said, they initiated 24-hour inspection coverage of the plant's control room, which is ongoing.     To date, the NRC said, its inspection has established operations control room staff has at times during various shifts, particularly the 2300 to 0700 shift, slept or otherwise been inattentive to duties over the past five months.     The commission said it also found management either knew and condoned the sleeping and inattention, or should have known about it, and either took no action or inadequate action to correct this situation.

"From our point of view, it's a question of entering into negotiations or discussions to make appropriate changes to contracts to reflect the changes that are going to take place on June 1," spokesman John Cote told Reuters in reply to a query.     Commenting on published reports that Imperial had suspended its oil supply contracts, Cote said: "It's not a question of cancelling or suspending any of the agreements at this point."     On June 1, Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation Board will lift its crude oil marketing prorationing system, regulating shut-in light and medium crude production, on a trial basis to the end of 1987.     Under the new system, producers and refiners will be allowed to negotiate volumes of shut-in oil to be delivered under purchase contracts.     Shut-in crude is the surplus between the total amount of oil being produced and the amount being purchased by refiners.     "We have talked to a number of our major suppliers, and we've discussed the upcoming change with them, but nothing has been finalized," Imperial's manager of western crude supply Gary Strong said.     Under Alberta's trial system, Imperial wants to match a reasonable supply of crude against the company's forecast demand for its refineries, Strong said.     "We have to know what they have and how that relates to what we need in total," he said.     Strong said figures on the amount of crude production Imperial purchases from outside suppliers were not immediately available.  Reuter ;

Jerome Sitter, director of ASCS's Cotton, Grain and Rice Price Support Division, said the decision meant farmers have until April 17 to file a farm operating plan indicating how many persons would be involved in their farming operations.     Earlier this year USDA extended the deadline to April 1 from March 1, Sitter said.     ASCA Administrator Milton Hertz said in a statement that the extension was necessary because of heavy workloads at county ASCS offices.     Hertz said ASCS county officials "have had to make a large number of eligibility determinations for individuals and other entities, such as corporations and partnerships, in preparation for imposing the 50,000-dlr-per-entity cap."

Israelis are one of the most heavily taxed people in the world. Under the new budget, about a quarter of which will go to defence, highest wage earners will pay income tax of 48 per cent instead of the current 60 per cent.     The bill passed less than an hour before the start of the new fiscal year on April 1. It was held up by debates over specific programs such as education fees and social benefits for low wage earners.     The radio said the budget passed by a wide majority. Last year's budget was about 19 billion dollars.     In January, Israel devalued its shekel currency by 9.75 per cent against the U.S. Dollar and the government agreed to lower taxes of high wage-earners in an effort to stimulate exports and productivity.     The government, trade unions and industrialists in January also agreed to extend 18-month-old price controls until March 1988 in an effort to avert labour unrest and a return to hyper- inflation. Because of the controls, inflation dropped to 20 per cent in 1986 from more than 400 per cent in 1985.  Reuter ;
TEST;31-MAR-1987 18:27:52.91;ANALYSTS SEE SLOW MOVE TO HIGHER U.S. PRIME RATE;     By Martin Cherrin, Reuters Quarter-point prime rate increases to 7-3/4 pct by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank today will be followed by other banks only after they see clearer signs of the Federal Reserve's policy intentions, economists said.     "Based on the spread between banks' cost of funds and the prime rate, it probably makes sense for others to follow, but no rush is likely," said Paul McCulley of E.F. Hutton and Co.     Citibank's surprise base rate increase, quickly followed by Chase, sent U.S. bond prices lower and the dollar higher.     McCulley said that once the spread between three-month certificates of deposit and the prime rate narrows to less than 1-1/2 percentage points, there is a strong chance of a prime rate increase. It has been under 1-1/4 points recently.     However, banks are likely to hold rate increases until they see what the Fed intends to do about interest rates in the near term, analysts said. They noted that banks historically like to follow Fed rate movements, rather than lead them. For example, the last prime rate increase occurred in June 1984 when banks lifted the rate to 13 pct from 12-1/2 pct after a Fed discount rate increase in April of that year.     Major banks had been posting a 7-1/2 pct prime rate since last August 26/27, when they lowered the rate from eight pct shortly after the Fed's half-point discount rate cut to the current 5-1/2 pct level on August 20.     "The banks will not rush to raise their prime rates. There should be a split prime for a while with some posting a 7-1/2 pct rate and others 7-3/4 pct," said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co.     Jones said the Federal Open Market Committee at today's meeting voted no change in Fed policy. But he said the Fed may well foster higher interest rates soon.     Jones said that, while the FOMC probably voted no policy change today, it may have decided to apply slight upward rate pressure later if the dollar weakens, inflation pressures heat up or the economy shows sign of strong recovery.     "The Fed clearly indicated that they did not intend to tighten policy when they did today's coupon pass," said Joseph Liro of S.G. Warburg and Co.     In a move that came a day earlier than most expected, the Fed today supplied permanent reserves to the banking system by offering to buy all maturities of Treasury notes and bonds for its own account. This seasonal reserve add is called a "pass."     "The Fed demonstrated that there has been no policy change," said Elizabeth Reiners, economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.      She said the spread between banks' cost of funds and the prime rate is now around 137 basis points compared with a 153 basis point average in 1986. Reiners said the spread is not really narrow enough to present a clear need for a prime rate increase.     The Dean Witter economist said that today's prime rate rise "may have been less a response to interest rates than an attempt to enhance the (balance sheet) bottom line."     Reiners said that, given recent problems with loans to developing countries, large money center banks with heavy exposures might be the first to match the higher prime rate in an effort to get more profitable spreads on other loans.     The Federal funds rate at which banks lend overnight money to one another could help determine how many banks match the higher prime rate and also how quickly they move.     In raising their prime rates, banks cited a higher cost of funds. In the three business days through Monday, the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another averaged nearly 6-1/4 pct. But quarter end pressures helped push up funds.       The Fed funds rate was extremely volatile today, reflecting demand pressure associated with the end of the quarter and the close of the Japanese fiscal year. Funds traded between five and 6-3/4 pct.     Once the special distortions end, analysts said the funds rate probably will return to its recent trading level in the 6-1/8 pct area. They said that, if it stabilizes near there, banks may not quickly boost their prime rates.     But a consistently higher funds rates would suggest to many that the Fed was fostering somewhat higher interest rates to help the dollar. Then banks would lift prime rates quickly.  Reuter ;
TEST;31-MAR-1987 18:48:13.83;U.S. FED EXPLORES COMMODITY BASKET INDEX;     By Alver Carlson, Reuters The complex task of wielding control over monetary policy in an increasingly fast-moving global economy could be aided by tying policy to commodity prices, the newest member of the Federal Reserve Board says.     Commodity prices are already considered by the Fed in the making of monetary policy. But they would be given a much greater role under an idea being floated by Governor Robert Heller, who joined the board last August.     He conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed, but argues that such an arrangement, particularly if it were adopted by other major industrial countries, could reduce the volatility of exchange rates.     Moreover, it could help stabilize of the prices of commodities themselves, slowing changes in inflation.     His idea, which many conservative economists find appealing, has some backing among board members appointed in recent years by President Reagan.     It would complement the present system of opening or closing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation, key indicators such as unemployment, and the rise or fall of the money supply. Changes in the money supply can lead to changes in interest rates and affect economic activity directly.     Discussed on and off for a long time, the commodity concept is part of a growing search for a system that anchors monetary policy and widely-fluxtuating currency prices to a more solid base.     "What is needed is an anchor or reference point that can serve as a guide for both domestic and international monetary purposes," says Heller.     In the past, this anchor was gold but the United States went off the gold standard because the global economy had vastly outstripped gold supplies.     A return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out of hand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largest producers of gold are the Soviet Union and South Africa.     The so-called fixed rate system, scuttled in the early 1970s, is still considered unworkable in the present world.     But the current system of floating currencies in which currencies can fluxtuate widely, adding vast pressures to the monetary system, is also being widely questioned.     Some have suggested that the system might benefit from a formal approach that mandates intervention by countries when currencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there are major problems with this also.     For one thing, there is justifiable concern that countries might be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might be detrimental to their own domestic economy.     Moreover, some question whether concerted intervention can make much of an inpact if the overall market does not agree with the fundamental judgement.     The poorest countries have called for a monetary conference to work out a new system that, not surprisingly, helps them cope with their overpowering debt problems.     Treasury Secretary James Baker, the Reagan administration's chief economic architect, has preferred to use the so-called Group of Five industrial countries or sometimes, Seven, as a forum to work out cooperative agreements on currency and other economic matters.    He appears convinced that officials from West Germany, France, Britain, Japan, Italy and Canada talking quietly behind closed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from public posturing.    The Heller approach, while extremely complex, could have a profound impact on the system, ideally stabalizing prices and international exchange rates.     As envisioned by Heller, a basket of say, 30 major commodities ranging from wheat to oil, would be put together and prices would be measured on a regular basis.     "In times of rising commodity prices, monetary policy might be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices, montary policy might be eased," he says.     He notes that commodity prices are traded daily in auction markets, and a commodity price index can be calculated on a virtually continuous basis.     Moreover, most commodity prices are produced, consumed and traded on a world-wide basis, so "that an index has a relevance for the entire world," he says.     In addition, commodity prices are at the beginning of the production chain and serve as an imput into virtually all production processes.     "Focusing on commodity prices as an early and sensitive indicator of current and perhaps also future prices pressures, the monetary authorities may take such an index into account in making their monetary policy decisions," he says.     However, he says that any major change in a basic commodity such as occurred in oil during the 1970s because of action by the OPEC cartel, would have to be discounted in such a system.     He says the worst thing that could happen is to allow monetary policy to spread a freakish increase in one commodity to the rest of the system and to other commodities.  Reuter ;

TEST;31-MAR-1987 19:21:41.71;EMERY AIR <EAF> TO BID FOR PUROLATOR <PCC> ;  Emery Air Freight Corp said it plans to begin tomorrow a 40 dlr a share tender offer for 83 pct of the outstanding common stock of Purolator Courier Corp.     The company said the tender offer is the first step in a plan to buy 100 pct of the Purolator shares.     Following the tender offer, Emery said it would offer 40 dlrs of junior subordinated debentures for each remaining Purolator share outstanding.     On March one, Purolator agreed to a 35 dlr a share leveraged buyout by eight Purolator executives and EF Hutton LBO Inc, a unit of EF Hutton Group Inc.     Emery said it had tried unsuccessfully to open merger discussions with Purolator before the company accepted the management-led buyout offer.     In a letter to Purolator's chairman, Nicholas F. Brady, Emery's chairman, John C. Emery, said the company would still prefer to negotiate with Purolator.     But he said the imminent expiration of the leveraged buyout group's offer has forced the company to make an unsolicited tender offer of its own.     Emery said its offer is scheduled to expire at 2400 EST on April 28, unless extended.     The company said conditions of the offer include the receipt of at least two-thirds of Purolator's shares outstanding, on a fully diluted basis, and the repeal of its share purchase rights plan.     Emery said the offer is also subject to completion of the previously announced sale of Purolator's Canadian operations.     Emery said Chemical Bank, Bankers Trust, Morgan Guaranty Trust Co and Salomon Bros had agreed to provide financing for the tender offer.     It said the junior subordinated debentures to be issued in the subsequent merger will carry a 13 pct annual interest rate, payable twice a year.     For the first three years after the notes are issued, interest will be paid, at Emery's option, in cash or in additional notes, Emery said.     It added that the notes will not be subject to redemption for one year after they are issued.     Emery said Purolator would operate as a wholly owned unit of the company after the merger. It said it hoped Purolator's management would continue with the company.     "We believe that our two companies provide an excellent fit with each other and that the combination will enable each of us to better serve our existing customers and meet the challenges of the future," Emery's chairman said in his letter.     He said a merger would significantly enhance the financial turnaround that Purolator's management had previously forecast.     Officials at Purolator could not immediately be reached for comment on the offer, which was released several hours after the stock market had closed.     Emery's stock closed up 1/2 at 12-5/8.     Purolator closed at 34-7/8, off 5/8.  Reuter ;

Industry sources said the moves will smooth the changeover to screen-based trading and give the equities market one voice.     Westpac Banking Corp <WSTP.S> was one of the first to take advantage of the changes by announcing today it would double its stake in the Sydney firm <Ord Minnett Ltd> to 100 pct.     Brokers have been introduced to creeping deregulation over the past three years after legislation passed in 1984 to end restrictive trade practices forced the traditional partnerships to open themselves at first to partial ownership by outside institutions, and eventually to full ownership.     The phase-in period has ended, and several major banks and offshore financial institutions are investigating taking larger stakes in Australian broking houses, industry sources said.     Though deregulation was all but forced on brokers, most now acknowledge that the influx of capital and contacts from non-member shareholders has benefited the industry, they said.     "Deregulation has brought an infusion of additional capital and a broader base of products," ASX chairman Ian Roach told Reuters.     Roach said fears that major bank shareholders would impose a restrictive and conservative "bank culture" on the dynamic sharebroking industry were unfounded.     "So far the banks have been mindful of the importance of preserving the entrepreneurial aspect of sharebroking," he said.     But some brokers said others are sceptical and expect that the expiration of "golden handcuff" pacts, which tied partners to their firms for a period after incorporation, could cause a massive talent drain.     Several leading brokers have already announced plans to leave their firms and establish new private client businesses, while others plan public floats.     While bank shareholders have enjoyed dabbling in broking during Australia's record two-and-a-half year bull run, they could find themselves without the expertise they need during more difficult times, some brokers said.     Rene Rivkin, head of Sydney brokerage house <Rivkin James Capel Ltd>, said many brokers will resist anything that restricts their individuality and entrepreneurial spirit, and this could leave new entrants into the business short-staffed.     "If I were a bank I'm not sure I would have gone into broking.... What's going to happen when a lot of these golden handcuffs come to an end?" Rivkin said.     "Only then will the banks know what they've got," he said.     Rivkin's firm is 50 pct owned by Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp <HKBH.HK> unit <Wardley Australia Ltd> and plans a public float of between 25 and 30 pct.     "My relationship with the Hong Kong bank is wonderful. They leave me alone and give me all the support I need.... Maybe if we weren't doing so well there wouldn't be that support, but that hasn't happened," he said.     Other firms might not be so lucky, he said, and they could find it difficult to preserve their independence when the bull market ends.     In the last two years, the value of the Australian sharemarket has leapt 118 pct with turnover value up 152 pct to 31.24 billion dlrs in the year to June 30, 1986.     That growth put existing trading systems and clearing houses under pressure, and unification of the six sovereign exchanges should accelerate the development of screen-based trading and a single clearing house, industry sources said.     From July this year 30 leading stocks will be traded in a pilot of the ASX's screen trading system which, depending on its reception by brokers, is expected to replace trading floors over the next four years, industry sources said.

The U.S. General Services Administration sold 5,490 tonnes of tin in 1986, well above an agreed upon annual limit of 3,000 tonnes, the States of Malaya Chamber of Mines said.     In its latest annual report, it said the U.S. Had promised to limit sales of tin in a memorandum of understanding signed with the six-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in December 1983.     "The U.S. Appears to have lost sight of the U.S./ASEAN Memorandum of Understanding," the Chamber said.     The Chamber estimated the U.S. Strategic stockpile held 180,444 tonnes of tin in December 1986, 137,744 tonnes in excess of of its original stockpile goal of 42,700.     The main ASEAN tin producers are Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, which produce the bulk of the world's tin.  REUTER ;

The IML, Luxembourg's monetary authority, said this was partly due to the seasonal decline following the closure of bank accounts in December and partly to the dollar's fall.     But the end-January total represented a 5.10 pct rise on end-January 1986, the IML said.     The balance sheet total was also affected by currency fluctuations, and allowing for this, the January total represented a 0.3 pct rise on the previous month and a 13.6 pct rise on January 1986, the IML said.     There were 123 banks in Luxembourg at the end of January, a rise of one on the month before and of five on January 1986, the IML said.  REUTER ;
TEST; 1-APR-1987 05:04:43.62;TAIWAN SEES SHARP DECLINE IN SHIPBREAKING;     By Chen Chien-kuo, Reuters Taiwan's shipbreaking industry is expected to decline sharply this year despite the boom in 1986 because of keener competition from South Korea and China, the rising Taiwan dollar and U.S. Import curbs on steel products, industry sources said.     Last year, Taiwanese breakers demolished a record 344 vessels totalling 3.69 million light displacement tons (ldt), up on 165 of 2.97 million ldt in 1985, Lin Chung-jung, a Taiwan Shipbreaking Industry Association (TSIA) spokesman, told Reuters.     China scrapped vessels of some 1.1 mln ldt last year while South Korea demolished ships of 910,000 ldt, he said.     Yao Liu, president of Chi Shun Hwa Steel Co, a leading shipbreaker and steel producer in Kaohsiung, told Reuters, "We expect to scrap fewer ships this year because of an expected decline in our steel product exports."     Lin said many breakers predicted a 20 pct decline in scrapping operations this year due to falling demand from the U.S., Japan and Southeast Asia for Taiwanese steel.     Taiwan agreed last year to voluntarily limit its steel product exports to the U.S. To 120,000 tonnes in the first half of 1987 from about 260,000 tonnes in the first half of 1986, a Taiwan Steel and Iron Association official said.     Yao said the rising Taiwan dollar means Taiwan's steel exports are more expensive than South Korea's and China's.     The Taiwan dollar has strengthened by some 16 pct against the U.S. Unit since September 1985 and some bankers and economists said it could appreciate to 32 to the U.S. Dollar by the end of the year from 34.23 today, Yao said.     In comparison, the won rose by about five pct and yuan remained stable during the same period, he added.     "We have lost some orders to South Korea and mainland China because foreign importers have switched their purchases," he said.     Taiwan's steel exports to the U.S., Japan and Southeast Asia slipped to 148,000 tonnes in the first two months of 1987 from about 220,000 tonnes a year earlier, the Taiwan Steel and Iron Association official said.     He said he expected further declines in later months but did not give figures.  REUTER ;

Triguna, set up in 1982, is owned 40 pct by MHI and 25 pct by C. Itoh and 35 pct by an Indonesian company. It makes about 10 forklift trucks and a similar number of excavators each month in technological cooperation with MHI.     The spokesmen said the sale results from an expected restructuring later this year of the 50/50 Caterpillar/MHI joint venture Japanese company <Caterpillar Mitsubishi Ltd>, formed in 1963.     They said the venture will be renamed <Shin Caterpillar Mitsubishi Ltd> and capitalised at 23 billion yen.

TEST; 1-APR-1987 08:45:36.10;LONDON STOCK SYSTEM BIG SUCCESS, OFFICIAL SAYS;  The restructured London Stock Exchange has proved itself an unqualified success in less than six months of operation, according to exchange chairman Sir Nicholas Goodison.     More than 95 pct of the business has left the trading floor and is now conducted in the offices of member firms, Goodison said in remarks prepared for delivery in New York.     "Competitive bids and offers can now be seen on screens all over the country and business done is displayed on those same screens," he said, reaching more investors than before.     Goodison said the new system has helped investors by promoting greater competition that in turn has led to reduced commissions and spread.     He said the exchange is now working on a small order automated execution system and a system to transfer securities without certificates.     New laws to be enacted in full later this year will help the Securities and Investments Board investigate suspected abuses and punish wrongdoing, Goodison said. He believes it is a misconception to say that the U.K. system of self-regulation is not as good as the U.S. system.     He noted that any violations of the rules are a criminal offense. "There is no fifth amendment plea to offer a U.K. inspector hot on the trial of an insider dealer," Goodison said, in a reference to the U.S. legal system which allows individuals to remain silent on the grounds that they may incriminate themselves.     Goodison said a major goal of the London exchange is to persuade multinational corporations to seek a listing in London. He said about 200 U.S. companies are now listed in London, enhancing their ability to raise capital.      Reuter ;

The company said the move will reduce Asian overhead and a substantial part of the proceeds will be used to reduce debt.     It said as part of the agreement, its current direct investment in its existing non-consolidated joint venture with Ajinomoto will be converted into a cooperative arrangement for the long-term utilization of technology and trademarks.     The company said the change in the Japanese arrangement will give Ajinomoto full equity ownership while leaving CPC a continuing earnings stream and cash flow.     The transactions are subject to definitive agreements and government approvals.     CPC said not included in the 340 mln dlr consideration are proceeds from the sale of some smaller Asian investments, including a 51 pct equity interest in an oat-based food venture to an Australian partner.     The company said the actions being taken under its restructuring program, including the sale of its European corn wet milling business and other assets, overhead reductions and other expense items and the Asian transactions, will have a one-time positive effect on 1987 earnings.     CPC said "Although the extent cannot yet be determined, the company expects that 1987 earnings per share will increase by substantially more than the previously estimated 20 pct increase over 1986."

Speaking to an Agribusiness Education forum here late yesterday, Yeutter said the case was resolved at a meeting with Argentine Agriculture Secretary Ernesto Figuerras during a trade ministers' meeting in New Zealand last week.     Under a verbal understanding between the two ministers, Argentina will soon abolish export taxes on soybeans and products, U.S. and Argentine officials said.     The U.S. case brought by the U.S. National Soybean Processors Association alleged Argentina, through differential export taxes, implicitly subsidized domestic soybean crushers.     The U.S. crushing industry, in its complaint under Section 301 of trade law, said higher Argentine export taxes on soybeans than on products encourage the export of products and represented an unfair trade practice.     Yeutter told Figuerras that all agencies of the U.S. government supported the U.S. complaint and unless Argentina took steps to eliminate the taxes, the United States would consider taking further action in the case, U.S. and Argentine officials said.     An Argentine official here said no timetable was given for removal of the Argentine export taxes.  Reuter ;

The margins will return and this will be a better year than 1986."     In 1986, refining and marketing showed operating profits of 40.1 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.636 billion dlrs.     "We are also expecting to be in the black in the first quarter (1987)," Heminghaus added. In the first quarter of 1986, the refining and marketing segment showed a loss of 27.1 mln dlrs on revenues of 492.1 mln dlrs.         The executives were in New york for meetings with institutional investors aimed at increasing interest in the company's stock.     On the New York Stock Exchange, Diamond Shamrock was trading at 16-1/4, down 1/4.     Earlier this year, T. Boone Pickens offered 15 dlrs a share for Diamond Shamrock, and management countered with an offer at 17 dlrs and a decision to split off the refining and marketing operation to its shareholders.     "Our advisors convinced us the market would give higher multiples for pure plays," Blackburn said.  Reuter ;

He told the National Economic Development Council that the recent Paris meeting of major industrialised nations had agreed on the need for exchange rate stability. There was now a "reasonable alignment of currencies" and the U.K. Government intended to keep sterling at about its present level, he said.

In the past he has preferred to be less definite about the Government's exchange rate policy, lest it give foreign exchange markets set limits to test.

TEST; 1-APR-1987 13:30:47.42;TALKS WILL NOT DELAY TRADE CURBS AGAINST JAPAN;     By Robert Trautman, Reuters President Reagan's move to impose stiff tariffs on Japanese goods stems from deep U.S. frustration over Japan's trade policy, and he has no intention of calling off the sanctions, trade analysts said.     U.S. officials put down any idea of delaying imposing the 300 mln dlrs in tariffs, despite seemingly contradictory comments by some Administration aides.     And, they add, a visit here next week by Japanese trade officials and a visit to Tokyo by a senior State Department official will likely do nothing to change U.S. minds.     "Do not expect the problem to be resolved or the sanctions not to go into effect," said a senior U.S. trade official.     Reagan last Friday announced that on April 17 he would raise tariffs on certain Japanese exports to penalize Japan for breaking a 1986 pact governing trade in semiconductors.     The United States says the Japanese have not lived up to their pledge to stop dumping semiconductors in third country markets at less than production costs or to open their home market to U.S. semiconductors. Semiconductors - tiny silicon memory chips - are integral components of modern electronic goods ranging from television sets and personal computers to guidance systems on aircraft.     Some U.S. officials had hinted that the United States and Japan might come to terms on their semiconductor dispute in time to cancel the planned tariffs, but this has now been dismissed by other senior officials.     They noted that negotiations over compliance with the pact had been going on for several months, with little success.     Japanese firms this week announced plans to cut chip output and increase U.S. chip imports, but U.S. officials said Japan's move was too late to stave off the American tariffs.     The tariffs are to be imposed after a period of public comment, but Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and other officials have said neither the comment period or the U.S. and Japanese trade talks will serve to delay the tariffs.     Baldrige predicted the dispute would be resolved, but said "I'm sure the sanctions will go in before we work it out."     White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that while he hoped something could be done to hold off the sanctions, "it probably is not likely."     And U.S. Trade Represenative Clayton Yeutter predicted that Japan would not be able to comply with the pact in time to hold off the new tariffs on goods including personal computers, television sets, power tools and electric motors.     Trade analysts said that in any case, the U.S.-Japanese semiconductor dispute was only one of many and trade frictions that will continue until Japan ended a policy of predatory pricing and opened its home market to foreign goods.     Other disputes include Japanese prevention of U.S. firms from taking part in building a new eight billion dlr airport near Osaka and selling a wide variety of goods in Japan, including many agriculture products.     A new trade row has now arisen over a Japanese decision to limit foreign participation in its telecommunication market.     U.S. officials have said the American telecommunications market is open to foreign firms and it was only fair trade to open the Japanese market to 33 per cent foreign participation, as Japan had previously agreed.     Britain has also protested the Japanese limitations.     American and Japanese negotiators are meeting to try to resolve the issue, officials said, but there was no sign of any early settlement.

The aid was to support the second phase, running to mid-1990, of Senegal's "courageous and far-reaching" medium and long-term adjustment programme.     Senegal's Plan and Cooperation Minister Cheikh Hamidou Kane said the country achieved positive growth of 4.2 pct over the last two years, against negative growth of four pct in 1984, liquidated its debt arrears and laid the basis of a sound recovery strategy.     Aims over the coming years include giving the private sector a more dynamic role in the economy and rationalising public sector enterprises.     He said Senegalese businessmen would make three "regional trips" to Saudi Arabia, the United States, and Paris, to discuss the Senegal's "new environment" with western investors.

The bank said it was also halving its yearly Visa card user fee to six dlrs, but would retain its 15 ct fee for each transaction.     A bank spokesman said the previously reported call by the Canadian Parliament's finance committee on March 20 for a substantial cut in credit card rates "was a factor" in the move, but he would not elaborate.     Canada's minister of state for finance Thomas Hockin had threatened legislation to reduce the rates, which apply to unpaid balances, if the financial institutions did not voluntarily act.     The Canadian Imperial Bank spokesman said "the bank card market is a very competitive one and we have to move to stay competitive."

Canadian Imperial Bank added that cardholders will be allowed to choose between the 15 ct transaction fee or the six dlr yearly card fee.     It will also eliminate the 50 ct minimum monthly transaction fee, it said.

TEST; 1-APR-1987 14:29:00.47;WALL STREET STOCKS/POLAROID <PRD>;  Rumors that New York investor Asher Edelman has acquired a stake in Polaroid Corp and optimism about tomorrow's status hearing on the patent infringement suit pending with Eastman Kodak Co <EK> sent Polaroid's stock higher, traders said.     Polaroid rose 1-1/8 to 74-1/2.     "Speculation that Edelman was going to take a stake in Polaroid was kicking around a few months ago, and resurfaced today," one trader said.     Edelman had no comment on the rumors.     A spokesman for Polaroid said the company had not been contacted by Edelman and no filing had been made with the Securities and Exchange Commission about a stake in the company.     "There is some hope among investors that there will some progress in the status hearing tomorrow on the patent infringement suit with Kodak," analyst Michael Ellmann of Wertheim and Co said.     Traders said it is conceivable that a trial date could be set or some progress made on an out-of-court settlement.     The suit, filed by Polaroid in April 1976, charges that Kodak infringed upon Polaroid's instant camera patent. In October 1985, the court barred Kodak from selling cameras or film that infringe upon the patent, the Polaroid spokesman said.     Ellmann said he feels it is highly unlikely that any progress will be made in tomorrow's hearing.     Ellmann said the stock may have also gotten a boost today from some optimism concerning new products the company is currently working on.     "Polaroid's announcement that a particularly senior company executive had been chosen to work on a major unidentified new product spurred some speculation about their products," he said. "I am speculating that the new product could be an electronic still camera," referring to a camera that records its images on magnetic disks as opposed to conventional film.

TEST; 2-APR-1987 02:43:41.98;JAPAN DENIES PLANS TO CUT DUTIES ON CHOCOLATE;  Agriculture Ministry officials said they are not considering cuts in import duties on chocolate to help ease friction with the United States over agricultural trade.     Japan has already lowered the duties sharply and we must consider domestic market conditions, an official said.     Duties on chocolate were cut to 20 pct from 31.9 pct in April 1983.     Washington has been demanding a cut to seven pct, equivalent to its own duties, ministry sources said.     Japanese chocolate imports rose to 8,285 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 5,908 in 1985, official statistics show.     However, the ministry sources added it is possible the government may make further cuts in response to strong U.S. And European demand.     "Due to concern about the farm trade row with the U.S., Top-level government officials may press the ministry to cut the duties," one said.     But he said it would be difficult for Japan to resolve its overall trade row with Washington and reduce its trade surplus, which reached 58.6 billion dlrs in 1986.     Agricultural trade issues between Japan and the U.S. Include Japanese import restrictions on 12 farm products.  REUTER ;
TEST; 2-APR-1987 02:51:07.09;INTERNATIONAL PACT ON OZONE DAMAGE LIKELY IN 1987;  An international protocol to severely limit the use of industrial chemicals which are believed to damage the earth's protective ozone layer could be signed this year, officials and scientists here said.     "By the end of this year, we should have an international protocol in place we can all be proud of," U.S. Environmental protection agency officer Bill Long told reporters.     The chemicals are chiefly chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which are used in refrigeration and making foam plastics, solvents and aerosols. The earth's upper ozone layer absorbs most of the harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun.     The officials and scientists were meeting in Tokyo, ahead of an international conference on the problem later this month in either Vienna, or Geneva, Long said.     Robert Watson, a program manager for atmospheric problems at the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration said a protocol should demand an initial freeze on the use of CFCs by industry. This should be followed by a gradual reduction in CFC volume until no CFC gases are released into the air, he said. The U.S. Has already banned use of use CFCs in aerosols and Japan has asked for voluntary restraint, but both still use CFCs in industrial processes.  REUTER ;
TEST; 2-APR-1987 03:15:00.61;C AND W OFFERED ROLE IN NEW JAPAN TELECOM COMPANY;  A Japanese businessman announced plans for a new telecommunications firm in which Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc would be a core company.     However, the plan, unveiled by senior Federation of Economic Organizations official Fumio Watanabe, does not specify what stake Cable and Wireless would have.     "The share holdings of the core companies should be equal," Watanabe said in a statement. "The actual percentage of shareholdings should be agreed by the core companies."     He said the eight core companies will provide directors for the firm.     "The new company shall immediately set to work on the feasibility study of constructing a new cable for itself," Watanabe said.     Watanabe has acted as mediator between two rival groups, one of which included C and W, seeking to compete against <Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd>, which now monopolizes Japan's overseas telephone business.     The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has said it wants only one competitor to KDD and has backed Watanabe's efforts.     A British source, who declined to be identified further, said the proposals could open the door to further talks between C and W <CAWL.L> and the other firms involved.     C and W had earlier rejected a reported proposal which would have given it a five pct share in the new telecommunications firm, compared to the less than three pct stake Watanabe originally proposed. C and W has a 20 pct stake in one of the two firms Watanabe has proposed should merge.     The British source said the decision not to specify the exact shareholdings of the core companies could leave the door open for further discussion.     "It's probably a sensible approach on their part," the British source told reuters.     C and W has also been pushing hard for permission to lay a new cable between Japan and the U.S.     The proposed merger has sparked an international row, with British government sources threatening retaliatory action against Japan for what they see as discriminatory practices against foreign firms.     The sources said last Friday that one option for Britain would be to revoke licenses of Japanese banks and securities companies operating in London.     The U.S. Has also attacked the original merger plans, saying that both rival consortia should be licensed.     Asked about participation by other U.S. And European firms, Watanabe said, "They will not be core companies but if they wish they could participate." Under the Japanese law, total foreign participation would be limited to one-third.     "It might be wise for C and W to join the new firm which has the support of many influential backers and work within this for the realization of their ideas," Watanabe told reporters.     The other core firms are Mitsubishi Corp <MITT.T>, Mitsui and Co <MITS.T>, Sumitomo Corp <SUMT.T>, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co <MC.T>, Toyota Motor Corp <TOYO.T>, C Itoh and Co <CITT.T>, and <Pacific Telesis International Inc>.     Watanabe said that his latest proposal represented his final effort.     If it fails to satisfy the British government, it will be up to the Japanese government to explain its position, he said.

They said this had come as a surprise and expected the targets, 2.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs, to be promptly tested in the foreign exchange markets. Sterling opened 0.3 points lower in trade weighted terms at 71.3.     Dealers noted the chancellor said he would achieve his goals on sterling by a combination of intervention in currency markets and interest rates.     Operators feel the foreign exchanges are likely to test sterling on the downside and that this seems to make a fall in U.K. Base lending rates even less likely in the near term, dealers said.     The feeling remains in the market, however, that fundamental factors have not really changed and that a rise in U.K. Interest rates is not very likely. The market is expected to continue at around these levels, reflecting the current 10 pct base rate level, for some time.

TEST; 2-APR-1987 05:36:40.65;NAKASONE SAID WILLING TO REVISE SALES TAX PLAN;  Japanese press reports said Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone has said he may compromise on his controversial sales tax plan, bowing to widespread opposition even within his own party.     The reports said he told a meeting of supporters of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party today the proposed five pct tax should be amended if there was anything wrong with it.     Officials were not immediately available for comment.     Until now, Nakasone had vowed to press on with the tax as part of his plan to reform Japan's 36-year-old tax system.     But most Japanese newspapers and news agencies quoted him as saying today he would not foist the tax on the Japanese people if they hated it.     Opposition parties and some industry groups say the tax breaks Nakasone general election campaign promises last July and would discourage consumer spending, needed to meet government pledges to try to stimulate economic growth.     Pressure for the tax to be amended or shelved is likely to increase soon, before a first round of local elections due on April 12, political analysts said. Resistance has spread from opposition parties and affected industries to the LDP.     Some 36 of Japan's 47 provincial governments have called for the plan to be scrapped or handled carefully, government officials said.     Some leading LDP candidates for the local polls have not asked Nakasone to make a campaign speech for them as they fear his presence would weaken their position in the elections.  REUTER ;
TEST; 2-APR-1987 05:49:23.68;COMPROMISE CITED ON SAN MIGUEL SHARES;  <San Miguel Corp>, SMC, and <United Coconut Planters Bank>, UCPB, have reached a compromise on a disputed block of 38.1 mln shares of SMC, the head of a government panel that controls the sequestered shares said.     Ramon Diaz, Chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) told Reuters SMC had offered a price of 126 pesos per share for the block, held in trust by the UCPB.     "It looks good," Diaz said. But he added several issues, including the identity of the ultimate buyers of the shares, had to be resolved before the PCGG gave its approval to the sale.     The PCGG's sequestration last year of 33 mln shares aborted SMC's bid to buy them back from 14 trading companies in the UCPB group. The commission said it suspected the shares were actually controlled by Eduardo Cojuangco, an associate of former President Ferdinand Marcos.     Cojuango, who headed the boards of both SMC and UCPB when he fled last year after Marcos was toppled, personally owned 24 mln shares in SMC. His holdings are also under sequestration.     "The shares that SMC now proposes to buy from the UCPB are owned by 1.4 mln coconut farmers," Diaz said. "Naturally we do not want them to go back into the hands of Marcos cronies."     PCGG sources said a compromise would end a row over a down payment of 500 mln pesos made by SMC's Hong Kong subsidiary Neptunia Corp Ltd in a bid to buy back the shares last year.     The UCPB had said the 500 mln peso payment would be forfeited because SMC Chairman Andres Soriano III had failed to fulfil his commitment to buy back the shares at an originally negotiated price of 3.3 billion pesos.     PCGG sources said SMC, the Philippines' largest food and beverage manufacturer, has agreed to sell 14 mln "B" class shares from the 38.1 mln shares to Australian brewer Alan Bond at a price of 150 pesos per share.     The PCGG sources said of the proposed 4.79 billion peso transaction, 1.6 billion pesos would be offset against the 500 mln peso down payment, the 500 mln pesos worth of preferred shares in UCPB held by SMC, 210 mln pesos in uncollected dividends on the UCPB shares and 400 mln pesos advanced to UCPB-controlled trading companies.     The UCPB rejected an original offer of 100 pesos per share made by SMC for 33 mln shares, which grew to 38 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend declared in June last year.     A spokesman for SMC said the company's 15-member board met today to discuss the proposed compromise.     The spokesman declined comment on the outcome of the board meeting, saying the dispute was under arbitration.     President Corazon Aquino last month asked SMC and UCPB to set up a three-man arbitration panel to resolve the ownership issue. The panel is due to submit its report by April 15.     Eduardo de Los Angeles, a government nominee in the SMC board, filed a formal complaint before the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, accusing Soriano and eight other directors of violating "fiduciary duty."     De Los Angeles was said to have opposed a decision by SMC's board last December to assume the 500 mln peso Neptunia loan.  REUTER ;

The company blamed the expected loss on regulatory and permitting issues that limited the full utilization of hazardous waste treatment cites in Califoirnia, continued startup delays for major remediation projects, the writeoff of an investment in a subsidiary and a settlem,ent with the California Attorney General's Office and Department of Health Services.

TEST; 2-APR-1987 09:11:32.01;TOSHIBA PRODUCES SUPERCONDUCTIVE WIRE;     By James Kynge, Reuters Officials at Toshiba <TSBA.T> told reporters they have developed a kind of wire which can conduct electricity with no resistance and therefore no loss of power.     Although other firms have developed such superconductive materials, Toshiba scientists said their discovery is the first that allows the material to be formed into a pliable wire.     Developing a superconducting material that works at room temperature with no resistance is the object of a frenetic worldwide scientific race. The main applications would be in super powerful magnets, small computers of immense power and speed, electric transmission lines which use negligible power, and electric generators which consume no power.     Toshiba said that it will probably be five years before it can incorporate superconductors in marketable machines.     But problems still have to be surmounted. Present superconductors, including Toshiba's, need to be cooled to very low temperatures before they can pass electricity with no resistance. This requires costly liguid gas coolants.     Superconductors developed to date transmit only small currents and cannot conduct alternating current, only direct current, government scientists said.     Toshiba, which spent 190.3 billion yen on research and development in the year ended March 31 1986, counts itself among the leading superconductor research companies in Japan, manager of Toshiba's public relations Yuji Wakayama said..     The wires the company uses are a blend of yttrium, barium and copper oxide and can conduct with no resistance at minus 179.5 degrees centigrade.  REUTER ;

TEST; 3-APR-1987 00:56:20.61;JAPANESE BANKS EXPAND HONG KONG PRESENCE;     By Allan Ng, Reuters At a time when Britain is threatening to revoke the license of Japanese banks in retaliation for restrictive trade practices, Hong Kong is rolling out the welcome mat to Japan.     The British colony last week issued a banking licence to the Bank of Fukuoka Ltd, making it the 24th Japanese bank here.     Japan has the largest banking contingent in Hong Kong, followed by the U.S. With 22 banks. Eleven Japanese banks have representative offices here and Japanese institutions operate 34 deposit-taking companies (DTCs).     Assistant banking commissioner K.K Wong told Reuters: "There are no special favours towards the Japanese...But because of Japan's strong economy and currency, they easily meet our requirement on assets (14 billion U.S. Dlrs)."     The Japanese control the largest share of assets of the financial institutions here but incorporated elsewhere, with 980.5 billion H.K. Dlrs at end-1986, or 57.5 pct of the total.     "Hong Kong authorities welcome Japanese banks," said Haruo Kimura, assistant general manager of the Bank of Tokyo. "But the U.S. And Britain are unhappy with the slow liberalisation of the Tokyo financial market."     Japanese bankers said Hong Kong offers good business opportunities, especially in China trade, to Japanese banks who are following their clients' international expansion.     "As their clients become more international, they have to keep up and follow them," said Yutaka Toda, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank's general manager here.     "We can have access to local traders and regional corporations," said Bank of Tokyo's Kimura. "We can also pick up business with China."     Bankers said more Japanese banks are on the way. An influx of Japanese banks began in the late 1970s when the government lifted a moratorium on new licences. But newcomers are allowed one branch each and only the Bank of Tokyo, Sanwa Bank and Sumitomo Bank have more than one branch.     Because of this limitation, Japanese banks have mostly concentrated on wholesale business.     "It is very difficult to compete with those giants such as the Hongkong Bank and the Bank of China," said Kimura of the Bank of Tokyo.     Bank of Tokyo has the largest Japanese bank network here with seven branches, while Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp and the Bank of China groups each have hundreds of branches.     To broaden their client and deposit base, some Japanese banks have taken equity in local banks. The latest such move was Dai-Ichi Kangyo's increase of its stake in Chekiang First Bank last year to 95 pct from 33 pct.     Tokai Bank, Fuji Bank and Mitsubishi Bank also have interests in small local banks.     But Mitsubishi, not content with its single-branch licence and a 25 pct stake in the small Liu Chong Hing Bank, bought Mercantile Bank Ltd's multi-branch licence early this year.     "We will open one more branch in (Hong Kong's district of) Kowloon soon, to better serve our clients on the other side of the harbour," said Mitsubishi Bank general manager Takeshi Tange.     Their weakness in the retail market forces Japanese banks to rely on the interbank market for funding.     Government data show that despite their large share of total assets, Japanese banks had only 54.4 billion dlrs in deposits at end-1986, or 17.1 pct of deposits of banks in Hong Kong incorporated elsewhere.     "Most Japanese banks' international lendings in the region are booked in Hong Kong," said a Japanese banker who declined to be named.     He said it is mainly for tax reasons, adding that assets such as loans booked in Hong Kong are not subject to Japanese tax.     Japanese banks are barred by the Tokyo government from issuing Eurobonds, but their Hong Kong subsidiaries can tap the Euromarket and lend the funds to the parent.     Bankers said this role could be undermined by a five pct capital adequacy ratio that goes into effect next year, requiring many DTC's to increase their capital. Many Japanese banks are seeking special treatment for their largely offshore operations or a different risk calculation for their assets.     "I don't think this will stop them from coming here," said a banker. "But it may mean they have to conduct some of their offshore funding operations elsewhere."  REUTER ;

TEST; 3-APR-1987 05:15:25.68;ROTTERDAM'S MAIN GRAIN TERMINAL CLOSED BY STRIKE;  Grain handling at Rotterdam port's main grain terminal was at a standstill today as members of the largest Dutch transport union FNV staged a lightning strike for the third day running.     Pieter van der Vorm, managing director of Graan Elevator Mij (GEM), which handles 95 pct of grain passing through the port, said their main Europoort terminal was out of action because of a strike by technical staff.     The actions, in support of union demands in negotiations over a new labour agreement, began on Wednesday when grain handlers stopped work.     Van der Vorm said that if strikes continued on today's scale for some time vessels coming to unload grain in Rotterdam would face delays, but this was not happening yet.     Wednesday's actions left GEM's facilities 40 pct operational, and there were only limited strikes yesterday.     Talks between unions and employers yesterday and today produced no result, but FNV spokesman Bert Duim said the union was prepared to put their key demand, for a 36 hour working week, at the bottom of the agenda.     Van der Vorm said, however, the union's demands on a range of issues were far in excess of the management's final offer.  REUTER ;
TEST; 3-APR-1987 05:22:22.73;REAGAN'S STRENGTH IN U.S. CONGRESS APPEARS SAPPED;     By Michael Gelb, Reuters President Reagan's reduced strength in Congress has been demonstrated by the U.S. Senate's decision to approve a highway spending bill despite his attempts to veto it, political analysts said.     "He's very weakened," said William Schneider of the private American Enterprise public policy group after the Senate voted 67-33 yesterday to ignore Reagan's veto of the road bill.     Schneider contrasted Reagan's failure with his previous ability to win clear majorities on major issues.     Sustaining his veto required him to win just one-third of the votes in either house of Congress.     It was the third consecutive fight over a presidential veto on which Congress had defied Reagan, whose clout with the legislature has been greatly diminished by the arms-for-Iran scandal and the capture of a majority in the Senate by the opposition Democratic party in the November 1986 election.     Congress overrode Reagan's veto of a popular water projects bill in January and last autumn Congress rejected his veto of economic sanctions against South Africa.     But this time the president laid his full authority on the line, even making a rare journey to Capitol Hill to plead for support in person.     With both the House and Senate in Democratic hands, analysts say Reagan is swiftly becoming a lame duck, facing difficulties in enacting his own legislative agenda, especially given the furore over the Iran arms deal.     The situation contrasts with Reagan's first six years in office when a Republican-controlled Senate and the backing of conservative Democrats in the House enabled Reagan to win passage of most of his legislative priorities.     Reagan's ability to veto legislation he dislikes had been his strongest weapon in dealing with Congress, but his defeat on the highway bill was expected to reduce the credibility of his veto power.     Senator John Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican, told the New York Times earlier this week that if Reagan lost "there will be no brake on -- if you suggest a presidential veto you will be laughed away."     Yesterday's defeat came two days after the House of Representatives' overwhelming rejection of a presidential veto on the highways bill by 350 votes to 73.     White House strategists had presented the veto fight as a test of Reagan's strength as he attempted to recover from the scandal over secret arms sales to Iran.     Senate Republican leader Robert Dole of Kansas pleaded with fellow party members to back Reagan because "this may determine the strength of the presidency for the next 21 months."     The defeat showed the problems facing any president in his final years in office. Reagan's term expires in January 1989.     A majority of Republicans in the House of Representatives and 13 in the Senate apparently decided their own political concerns have become more important than the president's.     "President Reagan, he ain't going to be running in 1988, but I am," Congressman Arthur Ravenel, a South Carolina Republican, said on Tuesday of his decision to back a bill that means money and jobs for his home district in new highway construction.     The defeat interrupted a good streak for Reagan, who won applause for his selection in February of former Senate majority leader Howard Baker to replace Donald Regan as White House chief of staff, and was believed by most political analysts to have benefitted from a televised speech and a news conference on the Iran affair last month.     A steady drop in Reagan's job approval ratings appeared to level off in recent weeks. The president slumped from about 65 pct last autumn to about 42 pct after the Tower Commission report in February said he had failed to exercise proper control over the dealings with Iran.     His approval rating hovers at 50 pct.     Reagan said he was deeply disappointed by the Senate defeat but "my efforts to control spending are not diminished."     Democratic leader Robert Byrd said "this isn't going to make or break the president."  REUTER ;

The dollar firmed slightly from its opening 1.8135/45 marks in very quiet pre-weekend trading and dealers said they expected business to remain thin this afternoon.     "Trading is at an absolute nil, nobody wants to get involved ahead of next week's meetings," one dealer with a U.S. Bank said, referring to the Group of Seven industrial nations and the International Monetary Fund meetings in Washington.     Dealers saw the dollar staying at current levels but possibly rising above 1.83 marks on any supporting remarks emerging from the meetings. "But the dollar's medium-term direction is soft," one dealer said.     The dollar could well come under renewed pressure after the international forums as attention returned to the U.S. And the U.K.'s trade dispute with Japan, dealers said.     Cross currency trading was also subdued though sterling's rise above 1.60 dlrs helped it to firm against the mark. It was fixed higher at 2.924 marks after yesterday's 2.910.     The pound was seen staying between 2.90 and 2.93 marks for the next days, dealers said.     Eurodollar deposit rates were steady from this morning, with six month funds unchanged at midpoint 6-11/16 pct. Six month euromarks stayed at midpoint 3-7/8 pct.

TEST; 3-APR-1987 08:32:08.71;U.S. MARCH JOBLESS RATE FELL TO 6.6 PCT;  The U.S. civilian unemployment rate fell to 6.6 pct in March from 6.7 pct in February, the Labor Department said.     The number of non-farm payroll jobs rose 164,000 last month after rising a revised 236,000 in February. That was down from the previously reported 337,000 rise in February.     The March unemployment rate was the lowest since March, 1980. It had remained unchanged at 6.7 pct for three straight months before the March decline.     The rise in non-farm payrolls was the smallest since a decline last June of 75,000, the department said.     Last month's unemployment rate was down from the 7.2 pct level in March, 1986.     Growth in jobs continued in March but was slower than in recent months, with the gains concentrated in service industries.     The number of goods-producing jobs fell 68,000 in March, while service-producing jobs rose 232,000 to bring the total jobs in the department's survey of businesses to 102.03 mln in March.     Business and health services showed the largest gains in jobs, while manufacturing employment fell by 25,000.     The average work week fell to 34.8 hours in March from 35.0 hours in February, the department said.     Manufacturing hours fell to 40.9 per week from 41.2 hours in February, but overtime hours increased to 3.7 from 3.6.     The department's survey of households showed the number of unemployed stood at 7.85 mln out of a work force of 119.2 mln.     The number of persons working part time for economic reasons fell in March to 5.46 mln from 5.78 mln in February.     The loss of factory jobs brought the March total to 19.19 mln jobs and was concentrated in automobile, electrical and electronic manufacturing.     Construction employment also lowered the number of jobs in the goods-producing sector, falling by 45,000 after seasonal adjustment, the department said.     Mining employment was little changed in March and has not experienced any substantial erosion since the rapid job losses in oil and gas drilling in the first two-thirds of 1986.     Other service industries that increased jobs last month were finance, insurance, and real estate.  Reuter ;

TEST; 3-APR-1987 10:22:32.46;PAKISTAN NOT SEEN AS MAJOR WHEAT EXPORTER;  Pakistan is not emerging as a major wheat exporter as world market prospects are not good enough, Sartaj Aziz, Special Assistant on Food and Agriculture to the Pakistani Prime Minister, said in an interview.     No exports are planned for the next 12 months or so and plans last year to sell one mln tonnes to Iran came to nothing because they could not agree a price, he said.     Aziz forecast that Pakistan may have exportable surpluses of one mln tonnes or a half mln tonnes over the next few harvests in years when the weather is favourable.     The government does not wish to increase output much above this because of low world prices, and the land would be better used for other crops.     Aziz said the Pakistani government does not want area sown to wheat to increase from the current seven mln hectares. Some 10 pct of that area which gives low yields could be switched to more profitable crops such as oilseeds.     The aim is to concentrate on raising yields from the current 1.8 to 1.9 tonnes per ha to at least 2.5 tonnes per ha over the next five to seven years, he said.     Aziz said the current 1986/87 crop, harvesting of which is just beginning, is expected to yield around a record 14.5 mln tonnes. This compares with a target of 14.7 mln and last year's yield of 14.0 mln.     He said rains some six weeks ago helped the crop but more recent rains reduced prospects slightly.     The long-term wheat production target is for some 17 mln tonnes by mid-1993, taking into account Pakistan's annual population growth rate of more than three pct. Current consumption is some 12.5 mln tonnes.     The current wheat reserve is 2.5 mln tonnes, Aziz said. This compares with a minimum reserve commitment of one mln tonnes, which Pakistan will maintain at all costs, and a "strategic reserve" target of two mln tonnes.     Despite the fact that stocks are a half-mln tonnes over target, the surplus will not be exported at present, he said.     The government wants to keep an extra "safety margin" until it sees what effect the abolition of a 44-year-old wheat rationing system will have on domestic consumption. New exports will be considered only in about a year's time when the 1987/88 crop can be gauged as well, he said.     The new domestic policy, introduced on March 15, is for the government to supply unlimited quantities of wheat at two rupees per kilo. With other costs this means a price in Pakistani markets of between 2.30 and 2.50 rupees per kilo.     Under the old system, introduced during World War Two and due to be phased out by April 15, some 50 mln ration cards were issued enabling poor people to buy wheat cheaply.     Aziz said following the introduction of a government support price in the 1970s the system become so corrupted that only 20 to 25 pct of subsidised wheat was actually reaching the consumer, the rest being diverted illicitly to the mills.     The ration system had also not had the stabilising effect on the internal wheat market that was intended, Aziz said.     Prices have already begun to fall with the introduction of the new system. The wheat price in Karachi, the most expensive Pakistani city, had dropped from 3.11 rupees per kilo on March 1 to 2.85 rupees on March 30.     Aziz said he does not expect the change in system to have a major effect on total consumption, but it may encourage better use of side-products such as bran.  Reuter ;

Arnold Lippa, Praxis' president, said Praxis will test the drug in a few hundred patients with full-blown AIDS, in those with AIDS-related complex, a precursor to AIDS, and in more patients with swollen lymph glands but no other AIDS symptoms.     Praxis reported a net loss of 2,186,000 dlrs for the year ended June 30, 1986. Lippa said the firm has about two mln dlrs left from its public offering in January 1985.     But Lippa expects to "easily spend" five to 10 mln dlrs in these new clinical trials. He said the Beverly-Hills, Calif.-based company is preparing a private offering and discussing ventures with other pharmaceutical firms to help finance the cost of the trials.     As another mark of the interest in AL721, Anthony S.

TEST; 3-APR-1987 12:00:00.52;EXCHANGE SEEN APPROVING "WHEN ISSUED" GILT TRADE;     By Sandy Critchley, Reuters The Stock Exchange is virtually certain to agree to change its regulations in order to permit "when issued" trading of U.K. Government bonds (gilts) as part of an experimental series of bond auctions later this year, market sources said.     "The principle that this "when issued' trading should take place has been accepted by the Executive Committee of the International Stock Exchange," said George Nissen, chairman of the Gilt Edged Market Makers' Association (GEMMA). "It's a question of how, rather than whether," he told Reuters.     The Bank of England announced in February that it planned a possible series of experimental auctions for gilts, similar to the system used to market U.S. Treasury issues, with the first auction possibly in April or May.      The Bank said at that stage that it was not opposed in principle to "when issued" trading developing in bonds in the period between the announcement of full details of the auction and the auction itself, as in the U.S.     However, "when issued" trading is prohibited under the rules of the International Stock Exchange, formerly the London Stock Exchange, and would require an amendment in order to proceed.     Nissen said discussions on the technical details of a rule change to allow "when issued" trading were still taking place between the Government broker at the Bank of England and the Quotations Department of the Stock Exchange.     The 27 gilt-edged primary dealers regard the introduction of grey market trading as an essential feature of an auction system covering part of the Government's funding needs.     "If we are going into an auction system, we need to have some form of market test of the stock we're bidding for," said Simon Hartnell, Head Trader at primary dealer Alexanders Laing and Cruickshank Gilts Ltd.     "The American WI (when issued) market certainly functions very efficiently," he said.     Nissen said he believed that if "when issued" trading were not allowed, market-makers "would be extremely unhappy about the whole auction."     Gilt dealers noted that it was a basic provision of Stock Exchange rules that dealing could not take place in a stock until it was listed by the Quotations Department. However, this was mainly designed to prevent a grey market springing up in equities prior to listing.     They pointed out that in contrast to the many uncertainties connected with an issue of equity securities, there would be few imponderables relating to bonds just about to be issued by the Bank of England.     Senior market sources noted that in any case "when issued" trading would be supervised by the Stock Exchange and would be subject to Bank of England supervisory guidelines.     Since the Bank of England and market-makers themselves are known to be in favour of the idea, the sources said, there was now a presumption that there would be scope for "when issued" trading to take place.     Gilt sales now are effected by means of large-scale stock tenders or by tap issues of stock tranches direct to the market. But greater market capitalisation following the "Big Bang" restructuring last year provided an opportunity for change.     A combination of both systems would enable the Bank to benefit from both the flexibility offered by traditional marketing methods and the guarantee of a steady supply of funds implied by auctions.     The Bank said in a consultative document published in February that possibly two or three experimental auctions might each raise between one to 1-1/2 billion stg.     The remainder of the funding would be conducted by traditional tender and tap issue means. Total gross official sales of gilt-edged stock were 11.9 billion stg in 1985/86.     Nissen said that market-makers had agreed unanimously with the bank's view that auctions would be more easily conducted on a price basis, rather than based on yield.     He said that the odds were also in favour of adoption of a bid price form of auction, where successful bidders were allotted stock at the various prices at which they bid, rather than a common price allotment whereby stock was allocated at the lowest accepted price.     Hartnell said that while a "when issued" facility was crucial to market-makers' adaptation to the new system, he would also have liked to see an extension to the "fallow" period proposal made by the Bank of England.     The Bank said that it would not sell by any method stock of the same type as that to be auctioned between the time of the announcement of auction details and a period ending 28 days after the auction itself.     Noting that in the case of long bond auctions, U.S. Primary dealers have as much as three months between successive sales of stock, Hartnell said the Bank's proposal was "very tight."     Nissen said that following a meeting between GEMMA and the Bank of England on March 3, which he described as "very helpful," GEMMA submitted a note making several further residual points.     Market-makers are now awaiting a further, fairly definitive, paper from the Bank which would contain details of auction procedures. Although the Bank has not yet formally announced a definite intention to proceed with the auctions, most market participants assume that they will go ahead.     "My own view is that we are on course and the first indications from the original paper - an auction at the end of April or in May - must be the best assumption," he said.  REUTER ;
TEST; 3-APR-1987 12:02:07.44;U.S. SENATE VOTES TO CUT PANAMA AID;  The Democratic-controlled U.S. Senate voted to slash foreign aid to Panama because of drug trafficking, but sided with President Reagan by refusing to cut U.S. aid to Mexico as a protest it is failing to cooperate fully with the American war against drugs.     In what Senate opponents of a cutoff said was a surprise, the Senate voted 58 to 31 to halve aid to Panama.     The measure, which the administration opposes, would need House approval before any aid would be stopped.     Panama is due to receive 28.5 mln dlrs in U.S. aid this year. A spokesman for the Senate Foreign Relations committee said if the House approves the measure too, half of this aid would be stopped.  Reuter ;

The mineral interests will include Asamera's 51 pct interest in the Cannon gold mine in Wenatchee, Wash. Asamera said the mine produced 116,514 ounces of gold in 1986 and is expected to produce 130,000 to 140,000 ounces this year.     Asamera said its talks with Breakwater Resources Ltd <BWRLF> on a possible merger of mining interests, including the Cannon mine, have been terminated. It did not elaborate.

TEST; 3-APR-1987 13:30:26.85;UK MINISTER LOOKS TO EASE TENSION ON TOKYO TRIP;     By Sten Stovall, Reuters The U.K. Government hopes for a breakthrough on the deadlock with Japan over trade policies during next week's visit to Tokyo by Corporate Affairs Minister Michael Howard, political sources said.     Howard, who leaves for Japan tomorrow, told Reuters he will try to promote understanding on trade issues during his visit.     Meanwhile, Britain will re-examine a letter from Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone promising personal help in solving the row over a U.K. Firm's bid to win a significant role in Japan's telecommunications market, government sources said.     Tensions have risen following Britain's decision to arm itself early with new statutory powers which it says could be used against certain Japanese financial institutions.     Britain reacted optimistically at first to the letter from Nakasone to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, seeing it as a signal that he would work towards ensuring a satisfactory outcome to the bid launched by Cable and Wireless Plc <CAWL.L>, government officials said.     But this view has since been clouded by reports from Tokyo that Nakasone's assurances really constituted little more than politeness in the face of British anger, they added.     Howard said he would use his trip to push for a bigger role in Japan's telecommunications industry for Cable and Wireless Plc. The U.K. Government has made the issue a test case for Japan's willingness to open its markets adequately to outside competition.     Asked whether the letter from Nakasone was a rejection of attempts by Britain to achieve that, Howard said "I am not sure it is correct to regard Mr Nakasone's letter as a rejection of Mrs Thatcher's request of him - and it says he is taking a personal interest in this problem.     "I don't understand it to be closed at all."     Howard added that during his Tokyo visit he would be "talking to them about it (the letter), finding out exactly what they do mean about it, and making it plain that we take a very serious view of the fact that access to Japanese markets is not as free as we allow access to our markets to be."     He noted that under the new Financial Services Act, Britain could revoke or deny licences to Japanese banking and insurance institutions in London if U.K. Firms fail to receive similar treatment in financial markets in Japan soon.     "I hope it won't come to that, and I don't think it will," Howard added.     During the trip Howard will meet officials in the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Ministry of Finance, the Trade Ministry, and Posts and Telecommunications Minister Shunjiro Karasawa.     Karasawa is regarded as behind opposition to any significant role for Cable and Wireless in the Japanese telecommunications industry.     Share prices on the London Stock Exchange were undermined again today by fears of a possible U.K./Japanese trade war. This was despite denials by Trade and Industry Secretary Paul Channon that Britain was on the verge of a trade war.     He told a meeting of insurance brokers today that Britain believed a "sensible solution" could be found which would open Japanese markets to British goods.     Government officials were at pains today to deny that Britain had set a deadline of three weeks for Japan to promise similar access to its financial markets to U.K.-based financial firms as that enjoyed in London by equivalent Japanese firms.     They said that Department of Trade and Industry officials had said yesterday that the measures against Japanese financial institutions could be imposed from then but that this did not necessarily constitute a deadline.     Experts believe Britain would lose out by acting against Japanese banks, insurance and investment institutions. But despite the danger of Japanese firms taking their trade elsewhere in Europe, Howard said he did not expect the move to backfire.     He said in a radio interview today  "it is true that we benefit from their presence - but they would not want to lose those advantages. And I am sure they are making their views plain to the Japanese government on this matter."     Howard, who will also be visiting South Korea before returning to London on April 11, said his trip to Tokyo was planned well before the current trade row.     Howard said his talks with Japanese officials would also include ways of jointly combating financial fraud in global markets with Japanese officials. This would be done through a cooperation between national regulatory bodies.     He said a memorandum of understanding for exchanging information to combat financial fraud would be sought with Japan on terms similar to one signed last autumn between Britain and the United States.

The ECGD suspended cover on Nigeria in 1984 after the country fell into arrears on payments of insured and uninsured debts.     Following last week's bilateral accord between Britain and Nigeria to reschedule the country's insured trade debts, bankers had hoped that talks would commence on a resumption of cover.     Breach told a businessmen's meeting that for the ECGD to consider "a gradual introduction of a package of new support" certain criteria would have to be met.     This would involve the Nigerian economic structural adjustment program being put into effect and being endorsed by the International Monetary Fund, the program remaining on course and continuing to be endorsed by the IMF and a satisfactory level of acceptance by the Nigerian government of the ECGD insured short-term trade arrears.     British exports to Nigeria exceeded 550 mln stg in 1986.  Reuter ;

TEST; 3-APR-1987 16:35:26.86;FEBRUARY FOMC VOTES UNCHANGED MONETARY POLICY;  The Federal Open Market Committee at its February 10-11 meeting voted nine to one to maintain the then-existing degree of reserve restraint, minutes showed.     The FOMC issued an asymmetric inter-meeting policy directive which gave greater possibility to firmer rather than easier policy. The Committee set a six to seven pct January through March annualized growth target for M-2 and M-3 and no M-1 goal. At the prior meeting in mid-December, the FOMC set a seven pct target for M-2 and M-3 for November through March.     The February FOMC kept the four to eight pct Federal funds rate "reference" range for policy, as in other recent meetings.     At a telephone conference on February 23, committee members discussed the possible implications of the decisions reached in Paris for U.S. intervention in foreign exchange markets. No conclusions were contained in the minutes.     In its inter-meeting policy directive, the February FOMC said that "somewhat greater reserve restraint would, or slightly lesser reserve restraint might, be acceptable depending on the behavior of the aggregates, taking into account the strength of the business expansion, developments in foreign exchange markets, progress against inflation, and conditions in domestic and international credit markets."     The February FOMC voted nine to one for an unchanged policy. Thomas Melzer, St Louis Federal Reserve Bank president favored some tightening of reserve conditions.     He noted the strong growth in bank loans in November through January and the firm federal funds rate that had prevailed despite the extraordinary pace of reserve growth. He also cited the recent declines in the dollar's value.     Finally, looking ahead, Melzer pointed out the potential for a further rise in inflationary expectations. He believed that prompt restraints might avert the need for more substantial tightening later.     Regarding inter-meeting policy adjustments, the FOMC minutes showed, "the members generally felt that policy implementation should be especially alert to the potential need for some firming of reserve conditions."     In this view, the FOMC said somewhat greater reserve restraint would be warranted if monetary growth did not slow in line with current expectations and there were concurrent indications of intensifying inflationary pressures against the background of stronger economic data.     One indication of potential price pressure might be a further tendency for the dollar to weaken.     The minutes showed that one member, presumably Melzer, preferred a directive that did not contemplate any easing during the weeks ahead. However, "most of the members did not want to rule out the possibility of some slight easing during the inter-meeting period, although they did not view the conditions for such a move as likely to emerge."     The FOMC members assumed that future fluctuations in the dollar's value would not be of sufficient magnitude to have any significant effect on the Fed's economic projections. In addition, they anticipated that considerable progress would be made in reducing the federal budget deficit.  Reuter ;

Most of the equipment for the 100 exchanges will be built in Stromberg-Carlson's Florida plant over the next three years.     "It is the most important thing that has happened in the Plessey telecommunications business," said Plessey Telecommunications Managing Director David Dey.     The British firm failed to win a four billion dlr deal to supply an advanced communications system to the U.S. Army in November 1985 despite personal lobbying by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

TEST; 5-APR-1987 05:48:12.28;ALGERIAN, SPANISH FIRMS AGREE QUICKSILVER PRICE;  Algerian and Spanish producers which together meet 40 pct of the Western market's needs in quicksilver have agreed to apply a minimum selling price of 300 dlrs per unit, the Algerian news agency APS said.     The agreement was made during a meeting here last week between Algeria's Entreprise Nationale des Non-ferreux et Substances Utiles (ENOF) and Spain's Almaden to discuss the market situation.     The two firms "took note with regret that prices quoted by some specialised publications do not reflect the reality of the whole market since they take into account only part of the deals made," a statement by ENOF said.     The result is that the prices quoted are far away from two firms' production costs.     "They have thus decided that their selling price would not be linked any more to the prices quoted by these publications and that sales would be made at a minimum price of 300 dlrs fob per jar, which is close to their production cost," the statement said.     It added that Turkish producers would join in when the two firms meet again in Madrid later this month.     The price of quicksilver on the London Metal Exchange hovered around 200 dlrs this week.

TEST; 5-APR-1987 20:02:21.35;MARCH U.S. PURCHASING MANAGERS INDEX UP AT 53.9;  The U.S. economy in March improved at a faster rate than in February, with the National Association of Purchasing Management's composite index rising to 53.9 pct from 51.9 pct, the NAPM said.     The first quarter average for the index also was 53.9 pct. The NAPM said that, if this average were to continue for the rest of 1987, it would be consistent with real gross national product growth of about three pct.     An index reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the economy is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a declining economy.     The NAPM said the economic improvement was evident in all of the indicators in the index except inventories, which declined slightly.     New orders rose sharply in March, with production also higher. Vendor deliveries slowed, another sign that the economy improved in March. Employment expanded for the first time since August 1984.     Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM's business survey committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc <PBI> said "the economy ended the first quarter with a healthy, if not substantial improvement."     Bretz said the sharp rise in the growth of new orders in March assures a good beginning for the second quarter.     Some 50 pct of the purchasing managers reported that they were paying higher prices in March than at the end of 1986. Of those paying higher prices now, the average increase was put at 2.5 pct.     The estimated average price increase anticipated by members for the remainder of 1987 is 2.1 pct. While prices continue to rise, the NAPM said that most purchasers do not see them as being significant.     The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure, based on five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders, production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment.     The monthly report is based on questions asked of purchasing managers at 250 U.S. industrial companies.  Reuter ;
TEST; 5-APR-1987 22:05:37.40;AUSTRALIAN GAS LIGHT CO COUNTER-BIDS FOR TMOC;  <The Australian Gas Light Co> (AGL) said it will offer one share plus one dlr cash for every two shares in oil and gas producer <TMOC Resources Ltd> in a counter-bid to the previously reported takeover offer by Santos Ltd <STOS.S>.     The offer values TMOC shares at 4.75 dlrs each, based on AGL's closing price of 8.50 dlrs on Friday. TMOC shares jumped to 4.60 dlrs on the announcement from its Friday closing price of 4.15.     The AGL offer, the third to be made for TMOC this year, compares with the Santos cash offer of 4.00 dlrs a share.     Based on TMOC's issued capital of 62.08 mln shares, the AGL offer values the entire company at 249.9 mln shares.     AGL said in a statement that it already holds 10.5 pct of TMOC's issued capital. This compares with the Santos stake of 3.1 pct when it announced its bid in March 23.     <Elders Resources Ltd> began the auction for TMOC about three months ago with an unsuccessful 2.55 dlrs a share on-market offer that has since lapsed.     AGL said its offer is above the upper end of the range of values placed on TMOC by its advisers in the company's response urging rejection of the Elders Resources bid.     AGL said it will make the same offer for TMOC's convertible notes. Accepting share and note holders will participate in AGL's planned one-for-one bonus issue.     It said TMOC is already a partner with AGL in the Alice Springs to Darwin gas pipeline and has a number of businesses complementary with those of AGL.     AGL is the New South Wales natural gas utility while TMOC has extensive onshore holdings, mainly in Queensland where it owns the Moonie oil field and in the Northern Territory where it operates and holds 43.75 of the Mereenie oil-gas field. It also has interests in a number of gas or oil pipelines.  REUTER ;

TEST; 7-APR-1987 03:57:49.10;U.S. DOLLAR CLOSES LOWER IN THIN HONG KONG TRADING;  The U.S. Dollar closed lower after a day of thin trading as most operators were sidelined ahead of the International Monetary Funds meeting in Washington this week, dealers said.     They noted the Group of Seven industrialised nations is expected to meet and discuss currency movements during the course of the IMF gathering.     But some speculative selling of the dollar was noted on conviction that the Bank of Japan will intervene less during of the meetings. The dollar ended at 145.15/20 yen against Tokyo's 145.25 close and New York's final 145.85/90.     Dealers said, however, the Japanese central bank bought dollar persistently throughout today and limited the dollar's falls.     The U.S. Unit eased to 1.8205/15 marks from an early 1.8230/40 and New York's 1.8260/70 close.     It was under pressure also because most traders anticipated the currency meeting to bring little surprise, dealers said.     Sterling advanced to 1.6200/10 dlrs from an early 1.6185/95 and New York's final 1.6175/85 on rising support to the ruling Conservative Party of Britain, dealers said.     They said the pound gained ground on belief that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher will call an early general election in June.     But chartists said they expect strong resistance around 1.62 dlrs.     Elsewhere the dollar fell to 1.5137/47 Swiss francs from New York's final 1.5180/90 and was lower at 6.0600/20 French francs against 6.0745/75.     Asian dollar deposits were lower with the three months settling at 6-1/2 3/8 pct against Friday's close of 6-11/16 9/16 and the six months eased to 6-5/8 1/2 pct from 6-3/4 5/8.     The Hong Kong dollar stayed on the weak side of its 7.80 peg with the U.S. Unit, finishing at 7.8015/35 against Friday's close here of 7.8005/25.     Interbank rates were firmer following the local banks' move to raise prime rates by half-point to 6-1/2 pct, effective today, dealers said.

TEST; 7-APR-1987 04:23:10.63;TOKYO BOND MARKET CLOSES SHARPLY HIGHER;  The cash bond market closed higher in active trade led by securities houses' speculative buying and end-investor purchases of low coupon issues, triggered by declines in short-term interest rates, dealers said.     The yield on the 5.1 pct 89th bond of 1996 closed at the low for the day of 3.905 pct against the 3.955 close yesterday, and the 3.930 opening. The 5.3 pct 95th bond of 1997 finished at 4.010 pct against 4.165 at yesterday's close and an opening today of 4.100. Active dealing accounts of city and trust banks heavily bought low coupon issues on the rate decline and in expectation of a further fall, dealers said.     The lingering bearish outlook for the dollar is sustaining hopes of another drop in Japanese rates, regardless of what emerges from the expected meeting tomorrow of the G-7 meeting.     The key U.S. 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond due 2016 was 95.26-28 in late Tokyo trade against the 96.04-06 New York finish.     In the absence of retail participation, the key bond eased on dealer position adjustments on the dollar's renewed weakness ahead of the expected meeting.     However, some bankers said Japanese investors would return to the market, due to a wider Japan/U.S. Yield gap and demand for liquidity, but only if the dollar stabilizes.  REUTER ;

Of the total, 400 billion yen will yield 3.8502 pct on sales from money houses to banks and securities houses in a 41-day repurchase accord maturing on May 19.     Another 400 billion yen will yield 3.7991 pct in a 20-day repurchase pact maturing on April 28, they said.     The repurchase agreement yields compare with the 3.8125 pct one-month, and 3.7500 pct three-week commercial bill discount rates today.     Tomorrow's surplus is attributable to government tax allocations to local governments and public entities.     The operation will put outstanding bill supply at about 4,300 billion yen, they said.

TEST; 7-APR-1987 04:31:01.98;DOLLAR STARTS EASIER IN LONDON, STERLING FIRM;  The dollar opened easier after markets in the Far East had sold it down for yen, defeating new attempts by the Bank of Japan to check the yen's rise through sustained currency intervention, dealers said.     But trading was slow and uninsipired and although dollar sentiment remained bearish, especially against the yen, dealers expected no major movements ahead of tomorrow's Group of Seven finance ministers' meeting.     Sterling remained well bid as two new opinion polls showed that the ruling Conservative party had increased its strong lead, increasing the chances of an early election, they said.     The dollar opened at 145.05/15 yen compared with 146.00/10 at yesterday's European close. It closed at 145.25 yen in Tokyo after New York's 145.85/90.     The dollar opened at 1.8195/8205 marks after yesterday's close in Europe of 1.8245/55. It closed at 1.8205/15 in Tokyo after finishing at 1.8260/70 in New York.     Sterling opened marginally weaker on its trade-weighted index, dropping one basis point to 72.3. But it started firmer at 1.6213/23 dlrs against 1.6163/73 last night. It was also firmer against the mark.     The pound opened at 2.9540/9575 marks against 2.9490/9530 in Europe last night. But it lost some ground shortly after the opening, trading quietly around 2.95 marks.     Dealers said that with uncertainty still surrounding the dollar, yen and mark, sterling looks strong and attractive on due to an apparent surge of support for the ruling Conservative party, relatively high interest rates and a strong economy.     One opinion poll today showed the Conservatives had a 13-point lead over the opposition Labour party and a 17-point lead over the Liberal-Social Democratic Alliance. Another forecast a 92 seat Conservative majority in a new parliament.     One dealer reported a large sterling buying order from a Japanese institution earlier today.     But dealers were cautious to push sterling much higher amid wariness of intervention by the Bank of England. The bank was thought to have intervened repeatedly yesterday but it was not sighted in the market today, dealers said.     On the dollar, dealers said all eyes were turned to Washington where finance ministers and central bank governors of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations will meet tomorrow to review their February 22 Paris currency stabilisation pact.     Few expect the meeting to produce more than a vaguely worded confirmation of the Paris goals of currency stability and increased economic cooperation.     This outcome would almost certainly lead to renewed dollar weakness, especially against the yen, with levels around 140 yen well within reach, some dealers said.     "But you never know. Perhaps the Japanese do come up with some sort of stimulation package that would satisfy the market after all," a dealer with a U.S. Bank said. He noted news that Japan was working out a reflationary supplementary 1987 budget.     A senior official of the Japanese ruling Liberal Democratic Party said earlier today the party has drawn up the outline of a reflationary economic package including a 5,000 billion yen supplementary budget for fiscal 1987.     The dollar opened at 1.5130/40 Swiss francs against 1.5180/90 in Europe. It opened at 6.0525/75 French francs, down from its European close of 6.0660/0710.  REUTER ;

The dollar closed at 0.7092/97 U.S. Dlrs, after opening easier at 0.7040/45 from U.S. Lows of 0.7030/40. But the dollar still had not recovered to yesterday's local closing levels of 0.7109/14.     Traders are confident the local unit will return above 0.7100, and they regard today's fall as a correction in the currency's recent uptrend.     Traders said the Australian dollar, after trading around 0.7040/50 for most of the day, surged to its day's high in late afternoon trading on Asian buying.     They said offshore traders are still bullish towards the Australian dollar as yesterday's U.S. Selling occurred in thin volume.     Nervousness over the short-term direction of the U.S. Dollar ahead of the International Monetary Fund meeting also provided support for the Australian dollar. In Asia, the U.S. Dollar ended lower at 145.15/20 yen against Tokyo's 145.25 close and New York's final 145.85/90.     The U.S. Dollar also finished at 1.8208/18 marks against Tokyo's 1.8205/15 and 1.8260/70 in New York.     The Reserve Bank trade weighted index eased to 55.7 points from yesterday's 56.0.

An agency statement estimated the epicentre of the quake, which struck at 9:40 A.M. (0040 GMT), as being under the sea off Fukushima prefecture, some 240 km north of Tokyo.     On March 18, a quake also registering 6.9 on the Richter scale hit south-west Japan, killing two people.     Earthquakes of force six on the Richter scale are capable of causing widespread, heavy damage in a populated area.

The figures represent total clients' long positions as well as short positions, plus the net house positions as submitted by all members for each delivery month, she said.     As a result, figures will differ from those previously published but are hoped to be more accurate and to compare more favourably with other international markets, she added.     Since the introduction of a revised clearing procedure last October, which incorporated a system of "mark-to-market', figures as published bore little relationship to the true open position, the spokeswoman said.     The open position for business done up to the previous trading day is prepared daily by the International Commodity Clearing House (ICCH) and then posted on the various market notice boards.

He said the refinery will resume at about half its 178,500 barrels per day (bpd) capacity, as work on overhauling the North Side of the complex, which began at the end of January, will not be completed before the end of April.     He said the refinery had been closed for longer than originally expected due to the lengthy safety checks being carried out prior to restarting.     The explosion and fire, in which one worker was killed, caused extensive damage to the central part of the 32,000 hydrocracker and the spokesman said today this unit would be out of operation for several months. The remainder of the refinery, including the 19,000 catalytic cracker, was undamaged.     He said inquiries into the accident, which happened while the hydrocracker was not in operation, were continuing.     In an earlier incident, two people were killed in an explosion and fire at the refinery on March 13.  REUTER ;

The company said its Reliance segment sustained a significant operating loss for the full year 1986 due to the accounting problems and increased promotional and advertising expenses.  For the full year, it said it earned 284,000 dlrs, or 10 cts a share, up from 271,000 dlrs, or 10 cts, in 1985.     Cardinal Industries said revenues for the year were 30.7 mln dlrs, up from 23.0 mln dlrs in 1985.     The company said for the first quarter of 1987, earnings were about 48,000 dlrs, up from 13,000 dlrs or nil per share in the year ago period.  The year-ago first quarter earnings, however, have been restated from 101,000 dlrs or four cts per share.  It said sales for the first quarter were about 8,363,000 dlrs, up from 6,636,000 dlrs.

They said the decision brought the prospect of early general elections even closer.     After a tense eight-hour meeting, the Christian Democrat leadership late last night said it registered "the dissolution of the present government," in which the party provides more than half the 30 ministers.     Party leader Ciriaco De Mita told reporters that when Craxi went to parliament for a confidence debate. "There won't be a Craxi government any more ... I don't believe you can have a confidence vote for a government which does not exist."     Craxi announced today after being told of the Christian Democrat decision that a cabinet meeting would be held tomorrow afternoon and he would then go to the Senate (upper house).     The sources said that at the cabinet meeting the Christian Democrats, senior partners in a coalition including Social Democrats, Liberals and Republicans as well as the Socialists, would tell Craxi he had to resign.     If he refused to do so and insisted on a full debate they would withdraw their ministers, forcing the collapse of the government before a confidence vote, the sources said.  Reuter ;

TEST; 7-APR-1987 09:32:30.09;PALM OIL OUTPUT SEEN DROPPING SHARPLY - OIL WORLD;  Malaysian and Indonesian palm oil production is likely to drop sharply this year, due to lower yields, the Hamburg-based newsletter Oil World said.     The publication expects total Malaysian output during Jan/Sept 1987 to decline by eight pct to 3.05 mln tonnes. For East Malaysia, it put production during the period at 297,000 tonnes after 312,000 a year earlier and for West Malaysia 2.75 mln compared with just over 3.0 mln during Jan/Sept 1986.     It said new plantings had slowed markedly in both countries, but the effects of this will not be felt until 1988-90.     Above normal yields during recent years resulted in trees reacting to the stress by changing the sex ratio to more male inflorescences and/or aborting more female, Oil World said.     Yields per hectare are also likely to be adversely affected this year by insufficient rain up to 25 months ago. This could especially affect trees in West Malaysia during April/June, while in East Malaysia the impact will be in February/April and July/Dec, and in Indonesia July/Sept.     Last year's cut in fertilizer use will hit this year's yields and bigger effects are expected within the next three years, Oil World said without elaborating.     Opening stocks in West Malaysia at the start of this year were put at only 565,000 tonnes compared with 914,000 in January 1986, Oil World said.     West Malaysian net exports are therefore expected to drop 500,000 tonnes to 2.54 mln during Jan/Sept, while those of East Malaysia are likely to decline by 10 pct to 280,000 tonnes.     Indonesian palm oil production is forecast to fall about eight pct during Jan/May, but to rise from June on. Overall Indonesian output during Jan/Sept is forecast to rise three pct to 933,000 tonnes. Indonesian stocks as of April 1, however, are put at only 65,000 tonnes compared with 160,000 a year ago.     Indonesian export commitments and domestic requirements are both running at high levels, Oil World said, and it expects the country's imports to reach a record 110,000 tonnes during Jan/Sept. The bulk of this will arrive during Feb/May, ahead of the April elections and the religious Ramadan festival throughout May, it said.     Indonesian net exports, therefore, may fall by 29 pct to 350,000 tonnes, Oil World said. The possibility that recent Indonesian palm oil purchases will not actually enter the country but be transshipped to other countries to fulfill Indonesia's export orders cannot be ruled out, it said.

Hutton Group Inc EFH under which Hutton will terminate its merger agreement with Purolator Courier Corp and its pending 35-dlr-per-share tender offer, effective April 13.     Under its merger agreement, Hutton has the right to unilaterally terminate the merger agreement under certain circumstances, including its receipt of less than 66-2/3 pct of Purolator shares or the start of a higher competing tender offer, such as Emery's competing 40 dlr per share offer for Purolator stock.     Yesterday, Hutton's PC Acquisition Corp subsidiary extended its tender offer, which was to have expired at midnight, for two more days.  It said it only about 450,000 shares, or 6.5 pct, of Purolator shares had been tendered and not withdrawn, down from an 11.5 pct interest held earlier.     Emery's bid expires April 28.     Emery said pending the termination of PC Acquisition's merger agreement, PC has released Purolator from an agreement not to discuss Emery's acquisition proposal with Emery. Emery said as a result it is renewing its request that Purolatr enter into merger negotiations with it.     Emery said if it were to acquire 51 pct of Purolator shares or control of the Purolator board, it has agreed not to dispute PC Acquisition's right to receive fees that Purolator agreed to pay if PC were unsuccessful in acquiring control of Purolator due to the acquisition of control by another party.     The company said it has also agreed to let Purolator pay all of PC Acquisition's documented expenses in connection with the merger agreement up to three mln dlrs and Emery has agreed to pay the amounts itself should Purolator fail to do so.

TEST; 7-APR-1987 11:19:42.99;LIFFE, AFTER RECORD VOLUMES, SEES MORE GROWTH;  The records in turnover set by the London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE) in March could be surpassed in the coming months, Liffe Chief Executive Michael Jenkins said.     Last month, Liffe saw record monthly futures volume at 1.15 mln lots, and record monthly options volume at 97,700. Total Liffe volume in first quarter 1987 rose to 2.8 mln contracts, or 89 pct up on the same 1986 period.     Long gilt turnover in first quarter 1987 was 300 pct up on the year-ago period at 1.63 mln lots versus 409,500. But T-bond volume fell by 38 pct to 244,500 in first three months 1987.     Jenkins told Reuters the higher volumes for gilts reflected in part the volatility in the U.K. Markets in recent months, while the falloff in T-bonds was an indication of the relative stability of U.S. Credit markets.     Jenkins said he saw room for the whole financial futures sector to grow further in the coming months. In particular, FT- SE 100 futures had great scope for expansion, and turnover in them should be much higher by end 1987.     FT-SE futures volume was 62,700 in first quarter 1987, an increase of 124 pct over the 28,000 contracts recorded in the same months of 1986.     Institutions here had been slow to find out about the use of stock exchange futures, but they would now learn more, Jenkins predicted.     Commenting on the difference in popularity between gilts and bonds, Jenkins said Liffe had designed the widest possible variety of contracts so that at any given time, at least one sector would be volatile enough to attract trading. The current situation of U.S. Markets being steady, and U.K. Ones changeable, might alter completely in coming months.     A further boost to Liffe's volume and attractiveness should come with the introduction of yen bond futures, he added.  REUTER ;

April Brent traded as high as 19.40 dlrs a barrel today, or more than 1.00 dlr above May Brent prices, because of a supply squeeze, according to traders.     "U.S. energy futures are probably influenced by April Brent more than anything else today," said John O'Connell, assistant vice president at Refco, Inc.     May crude was up 18 cts to 18.85 dlrs a barrel.      "There is no reason to sell energy futures at these prices because the fundamentals have not changed," said O'Connell, adding that the OPEC pricing/production accord continues to hold.     Mixed trade participants dominated crude futures while local traders were featured in products, traders said. They said U.S. energy futures ran into resistance at today's highs.     May heating oil was up 0.46 cent at 49.25 cts a gallon after trading within a narrow 0.30-cent range.

TEST; 7-APR-1987 11:36:02.32;EC SOURCES SAY UK WHEAT PLAN YET TO BE APPROVED;  The European Commission has not taken a decision on applications from the British government for the release of 200,000 tonnes of intervention feed wheat onto the British market in May and June, Commission sources said.     They said last week's cereals management committee agreed to release 70,000 tonnes of feed wheat through weekly tenders between April 14 and May 26. It also indicated it planned to allow the release of another 30,000 tonnes from April 23.     However, it decided to leave consideration of the release of further wheat until later.     The British government had applied for the release of a further 100,000 tonnes in both May and June from British intervention stores to prevent market prices rising.     However, the sources said, the Commission wanted to review the market situation nearer the time before giving its approval.     The Commission was given new powers last year to control the release of intervention cereals onto the market, the sources noted.     Following last week's committee meeting, the U.K. Ministry of Agriculture said the Commission had given an assurance that additional quantities of intervention wheat would be made available in May and June. It also said that it was envisaged that monthly releases would be at least 100,000 tonnes, depending on the state of the market.     This lead to the widespread assumption that the Commission had actually approved the release of 300,000 tonnes during the three months of April, May and June at last week's meeting.  Reuter ;

Firm Argentine markets maintained levels in the sunflowerseed oil section but palm oil tended to move off early highs due to lack of buying support and the reported rejection of rbd oil offers by Pakistan at its tender today.

Paper discounted with the Bank also rose, by 477 mln guilders to 916 mln.     These rises were balanced by a 1.6 billion guilders rise in the Treasury's account at the Bank, made up mainly of repayments on housing loans by local authorities.

The Bank's gold and currency reserves rose by 484 mln to 56.89 billion guilders, while the value of non-gold holdings rose by 140 mln guilders, analysts said.     They added that the rise in the reserves was merely the result of commercial currency transactions by the Bank.

TEST; 7-APR-1987 12:28:58.61;ITALIAN BANK DEPOSIT GUARANTEE FUND APPROVED;  The executive committee of the Italian national banking association (ABI), representing the country's major credit institutions, approved the setting up of a common reserve fund to guarantee customer deposits in the event of bank failures.     ABI chairman Giannino Parravicini told a news conference that the fund would not be operative until the latter part of 1987, and only on condition that 60 pct of banks representing at least 75 pct of total deposits participated.     He said the fund would initially have 1,000 billion lire available and would cover deposits of up to three billion lire.     A statute for establishing a deposit guarantee fund has already been approved by the Bank of Italy and by an interministerial committee on credit and savings.     The 1,000 billion lire initial funding, which will be provided through contributions from banks which opt to join the scheme, compares with an originally targetted figure of 4,000 billion lire.     Parravicini said the fund would be gradually increased to 4,000 billion lire by end 1991, and that the decision to achieve this figure gradually rather than immediately was due to fiscal considerations.     The fund, still to be formally ratified by ABI's steering committee, will provide 100 pct coverage on deposits of up to 200 mln lire, 90 pct on deposits between 200 mln and one billion lire and 80 pct on those between one billion and three billion lire.     Assuming that all banks join the fund, contributions would be equivalent to around 0.25 pt of a bank's total deposits.     The ABI's steering committee later unanimously ratified the executive committee's decision to create the common reserve fund.  REUTER ;
TEST; 7-APR-1987 12:36:13.68;WALL STREET STOCKS HIGHER AT MIDSESSION;  Wall Street demonstrated its perseverance today as it recovered from an early wave of selling and posted a strong advance at midday. The gain was fueled by a strong auto sector as investors accumulated the stocks in anticipation of bullish news later this week.     The Dow Industrials, down 10 in the first minutes of the session when a weak dollar and falling bond prices underscored the market's lingering interest rate anxieties, recovered to stand at 2417, up 11 points at midday. The broader market showed less vigor, however, as advances eked out a lead over declines. Volume was a strong 106 mln shares.    Ford, up over a point for most of the session, stood at 90-5/8, up 1/2. Traders said that speculation that the company will announce a stock split and dividend increase at its board meeting on Thursday, encouraged the buying. Ford rose 2-5/8 yesterday.     General Motors rose 1-5/8 to 83-1/8 in anticipation of bullish news coming out of an analysts meeting scheduled for Thursday and Friday, traders said. Chrysler, not expected to make any major announcements this week, fell 1/2 to 57-3/4.     "With the bonds weak this morning, the blue chips have been holding the market up and that advance was sustained by an influx of foreign money," analyst Charles Jensen of MKI Securities said. "But poor breadth and poor performance by the transport and utility averages and the fact the market is at the top of its trading band supported in large part by foreign cash, makes this market vulnerable," he said.     Traders noted that Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's remarks today concerning the dollar's performance and its bearing on monetary policy, injected caution into many investors.  Reuter ;
TEST; 7-APR-1987 12:37:48.10;DOLLAR STEADY IN EUROPE AHEAD OF WASHINGTON TALKS;     By Rowena Whelan, Reuters The dollar was steady ahead of a series of meetings of leading finance ministers starting today in Washington, despite low expectations for the outcome of the talks and still negative underlying sentiment toward the dollar.     "There's too much disagreement between the Japanese and the rest for them to come out with anything unanimous," said one U.K. Merchant bank trader, reflecting the general tone.     However, dealers said position squaring helped push the dollar to a final 1.8240/50 marks, up from the opening 1.8195/205 and near yesterday's close of 1.8245/55.     Meanwhile, the pound was underpinned by today's opinion poll findings of further strong support for the Conservative Party, but fear of Bank of England intervention limited buying.     Dealers said they doubted the U.K. Central bank had needed to sell sterling to curb rises today, with the markets so quiet. The Bank of England was rumoured to have sold pounds yesterday.     Sterling ended at 72.3 pct on the trade weighted index, unchanged from the opening but off 0.1 point from yesterday's finish. It closed at 1.6185/95 dlrs, after an opening 1.6213/23 and previous close of 1.6163/73, and at 2.9490/520 marks, against an opening 2.9540/75 and yesterday's 2.9490/530.     Traders said there was little hope that the Western financiers will be able to find a lasting solution to the problem of currency instability during the current series of talks in Washington.     These are scheduled to start today with an informal Group of Five (G-5) session.     Tomorrow's Group of Seven meeting - of the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, the U.K., Italy and Canada - is seen as the key meeting.     Traders said few operators will be prepared to open positions ahead of news emerging from the talks.     However, some traders said that, given the low level of expectations, the market could be particularly susceptible to signs of accord between the U.S. And Japan, which would give the dollar a sharp upward push.     They said interest is still largely centred on the yen, with any fresh dollar weakness expected to show in that market first.     Meanwhile, today's comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker failed to have a lasting impact on the market. His statement that a further sizeable dollar fall could be counter-productive aided a brief run-up in mid-afternoon, but there was little followthrough, traders said.     The dollar finished at 145.25/35 yen, up from an opening 145.05/15 but below yesterday's European close of 146.00/10.     It ended at 1.5120/30 Swiss francs, against the start of 1.5130/40 and previous final 1.5180/90, and at 6.0650/700 French francs, after beginning at 6.0525/75 and ending yesterday at 6.0660/710.

TEST; 7-APR-1987 12:42:03.69;BIFFEX FALLS FURTHER BY CLOSE;  Dry cargo futures on BIFFEX extended early losses during the afternoon session to close 30 to 52 points lower because of uncertainty as to where the physical market will go in the near term, dealers said.     Initial panic profit-taking snowballed and triggered further sell stops. A 2.5 point fall in the Baltic Freight Index to 1030.5 further dampened sentiment after its strong advance over the past week, they added.     Rumours of lower rates circulated the market this afternoon, but some dealers said easier fixtures talked of today involved older tonnage and may not be representive of current conditions.  Reuter ;

TEST; 7-APR-1987 15:00:07.66;KANSAS CITY WHEAT LOSES EARLY GAINS, ENDS LOWER;  Hard wheat futures closed 1-1/4 to 1/2 cents lower in light trading as exporter selling erased early gains to close the market near session lows, traders said. May closed 1-1/4 cents lower at 2.72-3/4 dlrs.     Prices opened steady to higher on some follow-through buying from yesterday and hopes for new export sales in tenders scheduled this week. But selling by a major exporter brought prices off their highs, and the lack of strong buying interest reversed those gains.     Volume remained generally thin with little other fresh news in the market. Cargill sold 1.0 mln bushels of May, and Staley bought May and July, pit brokers said. Some intra-market spreading was noted with players on both sides of July/December at 7-1/2 cents, they said.  Reuter ;
TEST; 7-APR-1987 15:04:52.87;N.Y. PLATINUM FUTURES FINISH HIGHER;  Platinum futures finished higher as  the metal continued to follow the strong silver market, analysts said.     The key July platinum delivery settled at 572.20 dlrs an ounce, up 3.60 dlrs but below a session high of 577.50 dlrs. Other months gained 3.70 to 4.60 dlrs.     However, steady trade selling and skittish speculators kept platinum well below session highs. "Most metals players are in the silver pit, not here," said one floor analyst.     Meanwhile, palladium ended 25 to 50 cts firmer, but also under the day's highs, in sympathy.  Reuter ;

April Brent rose as high as 19.57 dlrs a barrel today.     Traders said reports that Iran opened a new southern front and Iraq attacked Iranian oil fields were also supportive.     Murphy said tonight's American Petroleum Institute report will need to show drawdowns in gasoline and distillate of two to four mln barrels each to support firmer crude prices.     "There is a lot of gasoline around," Murphy said.     Following crude futures, May gasoline closed 0.33 cent higher at 53.27 cts a gallon after trading 8,700 contracts.

TEST; 7-APR-1987 16:45:58.29;DOLLAR ENDS WITH MODEST LOSSES IN NEW YORK;  The dollar ended with modest net losses against most major currencies as the market conducted a final round of position-squaring ahead of tomorrow's crucial Group of Five and Group of Seven meetings, dealers said.     "The dollar was trendless today. People are waiting to see if anything new comes from the meetings tomorrow and will then take it from there," said one dealer at a top European bank.     As a result, generally supportive comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker and Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa went largely unheeded.     The dollar closed at 145.60/70 yen, down from 145.85/90.     However, the dollar's yen closing level was comfortably above its overseas low of just under 145 yen. Against the mark, the dollar finished at 1.8270/80 marks after falling to 1.8180 in Europe and ending at 1.8260/70 here yesterday.     In Congressional testimony this morning, Fed Chairman Paul Volcker harped on his long-held fears about the potentially catastrophic fallout from a sharp dollar decline.     He also said the dollar's fall, thus far, should be "large enough, in a context of a growing world economy and fiscal restraint in the U.S., to support widespread expectations of a narrowing in the real trade deficit in the period ahead."     The market impact of Volcker's comments was minimal. "It was the same old story. Volcker was just fulfilling his role as a defender of the currency," said one trader.     The market was similarly dismissive of Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's upbeat appraisal of his hour-long conversation with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker this afternoon.     Miyazawa said that they both agreed on the need for currency stabilization and that he was satisfied with the role the U.S. has played in coordinated international efforts to prop up the dollar since the late February Paris agreement.     "Miyazawa can talk until he's blue in the face. The only person who will make a difference is Baker," said Alan Rose of First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles.     "The key question for the currency market is whether the (Reagan) administration will have a change of view on the dollar. If not, the dollar is going lower," he added.     The dollar's recent tumble to a 40-year low of 144.70 yen was linked to the market's perception that Washington was unhappy with the rate of adjustment of world trade imbalances and that a continued orderly dollar decline was the least disruptive way of accelerating the process.     While most analysts do not expect any marked change of attitude in Washington, they were reluctant to open any fresh positions until later in the week.     "We are reserving judgement for the time being," said Doug Madison of Commerzbank Ag.     The tranquility of the dollar market spread to sterling trading today. The pound ended unchanged against the dollar at 1.6175/85 and edged up to 2.957 marks from 2.955 yesterday.     However, underyling sentiment remains positive after a U.K. opinion poll gave the ruling Conservative party its highest popularity rating since it was re-elected in 1983.     "Sterling still seems to be on the firm side," said one dealer.     The Canadian currency also retained a generally stronger tone, rising to 1.3055/60 to its U.S. counterpart from 1.3080/85 yesterday.     According to figures provided by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co, the dollar's trade-weighted value at midday was 5.7 pct below average market rates in 1980-82, compared with 5.5 pct yesterday.  Reuter ;

Nacco said its North American Coal Corp unit has received notice that Consolidation Coal Co, a unit of Du Pont Co <DD>, will exercise an option to buy all of the stock of Quarto Mining Co, a subsidiary of North American Coal.     For the stock, North American Coal will receive about 15.2 mln dlrs, 5.2 mln of which will be paid at closing April 10 and the rest in installments, the company said.     In addition, Quarto will pay a dividend to North American Coal of about 10 mln dlrs from retained earnings before closing. The funds were previously used to finance mining operations.     Consolidation Coal got the option from the Capco Group of utilities, which received the option from Nacco in 1981.     Nacco reported earnings of 10.8 mln dlrs or 1.11 dlrs a share in last year's second quarter.

Speaking at a news conference, Reviglio said the two projects will eventually bring in some 300 mln dlrs annually in foreign exchange to Venezuela and help diversify the country's export base. "Joint ventures are the principal instrument for allowing the resources of the industrialized countries to be channeled to the developing world so as to lead future growth for both," Reviglio said.     ENI's subsidiary Ecofuel will join Pequiven, the petrochemical subsidiary of PDVSA in building a 160 mln dlr plant to produce mtbe, a gasoline additive used to increase octane levels.     The 500,000 mt per year plant will be constructed at Jose in eastern Venezuela, and fed by butane produced at PDVSA's eastern cryogenic complex. ENI owns 48 pct of the joint venture company, Super Octanos, C.A., while Pequiven has 49 pct, with the remaining three pct to be sold to private investors.     Production is set to begin in third quarter 1989. Ecofuel officials said the plant is modeled after one in Saudi Arabia.     Another ENI subsidiary, Agip Carbone, will sign a letter of intent in Caracas tomorrow to enter a partnership with PDVSA to mine the coal deposits at guasare in western zulia state, he said.     Feasibility studies are still being done on the carbozulia project, with a definitive accord slated for august, he added.     Agip carbone and atlantic richfield coal, an arco subsidiary have formed a consortium which will own 48 pct of the carbozulia project, whose total cost is estimated at 500 mln dlrs, the company said.

The key 7-1/2 pct Treasury bonds of 2016 fell 1-3/32 points to close at 95-1/32 and a 7.94 pct yield that was up 10 basis points from Monday and was 1987's highest closing yield.     "Investors threw in the towel today. The long bond seems headed for eight pct within the next few days," a trader said. That would correspond to a price of about 94-3/8.     Treasury bill rates increased two to eight basis points. Notes prices declined 1/8 to 3/4.     Bond traders said the main negative is recent instability of the dollar and growing feeling that even concerted central bank support will not be able to prevent a further sharp decline in the U.S. currency.     The dollar came under mild downward pressure early and finished with modest net losses. The currency was largely unaffected by generally supportive comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker and Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.     Miyazawa once again said he and Treasury Secretary James Baker agree on the need for stable foreign exchange rates.     Fed Chairman Paul Volcker told Congress that the dollar's fall thus far should be "large enough, in a context of a growing world economy and fiscal restraint in the U.S., to support widespread expectations of a narrowing in the real trade deficit in the period ahead."     Despite favorable comments by Volcker and Miyazawa, there appears to be broad agreement among currency and bond market participants that a huge Federal budget deficit and a wide, although narrowing, trade gap will further depress the dollar. That could mean Japanese and other foreign investors will buy fewer U.S. bonds or even start selling them.     There has been no evidence of large-scale sales of U.S. bonds by the Japanese. Some dealers said that these investors actually purchased a modest amount of U.S. debt today, but they focused on shorter maturities in the two-year area rather than on long bonds.     To the extent that overseas investors back away from the U.S. bond market, dealers said that higher yields will be needed to lure others to take their place.     A late Federal funds rate rise contributed slightly to the bond market retreat. After averaging 6.20 pct yesterday, funds opened at 6-1/8 pct and traded between 6-1/16 and 6-1/4 pct.     The Federal funds rate rise occurred despite the Fed's unexpected direct supply of temporary reserves. The Fed arranged two-day System repurchase agreements with funds trading at 6-1/8 pct.     Treasury bill rates increased largely in response to the higher funds rate. Rates on new three and six-month bills rose two and seven basis points from Monday's auction averages to close at 5.55/54 pct and 5.70/69 pct. Year bills at 5.81/80 pct were up eight basis points from yesterday's close.     Among notes, the 6-3/8s of 1989 dropped 1/8 to 99-9/16, with the 7-1/4s of 1996 down 3/4 at 97-3/8.  Reuter ;

MITI is expected to lower the projection for primary energy supplies in the year 2000 to 550 mln kilolitres (kl) from 600 mln, they said.     The decision follows the emergence of structural changes in Japanese industry following the rise in the value of the yen and a decline in domestic electric power demand.     MITI is planning to work out a revised energy supply/demand outlook through deliberations of committee meetings of the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, the officials said.     They said MITI will also review the breakdown of energy supply sources, including oil, nuclear, coal and natural gas.

TEST; 8-APR-1987 01:48:20.11;INDONESIA SEES CPO PRICE RISING SHARPLY;  Indonesia expects crude palm oil (CPO) prices to rise sharply to between 450 and 550 dlrs a tonne FOB sometime this year because of better European demand and a fall in Malaysian output, Hasrul Harahap, junior minister for tree crops, told Indonesian reporters.     Prices of Malaysian and Sumatran CPO are now around 332 dlrs a tonne CIF for delivery in Rotterdam, traders said.     Harahap said Indonesia would maintain its exports, despite making recent palm oil purchases from Malaysia, so that it could possibly increase its international market share.     Indonesia, the world's second largest producer of palm oil after Malaysia, has been forced to import palm oil to ensure supplies during the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan.     Harahap said it was better to import to cover a temporary shortage than to lose export markets.     Indonesian exports of CPO in calendar 1986 were 530,500 tonnes, against 468,500 in 1985, according to central bank figures.  REUTER ;

Banks, which bid for a total 12.2 billion marks liquidity, will be credited with the funds allocated today and must buy back securities pledged on May 6.     Some 14.9 billion marks will drain from the market today as an earlier pact expires, so the Bundesbank is effectively withdrawing a net 8.1 billion marks from the market with today's allocation.     A Bundesbank spokesman said in answer to enquiries that the withdrawal of funds did not reflect a tightening of credit policy, but was to be seen in the context of plentiful liquidity in the banking system.     Banks held an average 59.3 billion marks at the Bundesbank over the first six days of the month, well clear of the likely April minimum reserve requirement of 51 billion marks.     The Bundesbank spokesman noted that by bidding only 12.2 billion marks, below the outgoing 14.9 billion, banks themselves had shown they felt they had plenty of liquidity.     Dealers said the Bundesbank is keen to prevent too much liquidity accruing in the market, as that would blunt the effectiveness of the security repurchase agreement, its main open-market instrument for steering market interest rates. Two further pacts are likely this month over the next two weeks.     The Bundesbank is currently steering call money between 3.6 and 3.8 pct, although short-term fluctuations outside that range are possible, dealers said.  REUTER ;

Atlas, the Philippines' biggest copper producer, said it had been hit by depressed world copper prices. It reported a net loss of 976.38 mln pesos in the year ending December 1986, compared with a net loss of 1.53 billion in 1985.     The company said it had been able to cut its losses because its scaled-down copper operations in the central island of Cebu started in the second half of 1986.     Atlas said negotiations were continuing on the acquisition by Bond of the company's existing bank loans and their restructuring into a gold loan.     A memorandum of understanding signed by the two sides in October last year said Bond would acquire Atlas' total loans of 275 mln dlrs, to be repaid by the mining company in gold.     Atlas said the two sides were also discussing equity infusion into Atlas and the creation of a development fund for further exploration and development of the company's gold properties in the central province of Masbate.     Wilson Banks, general manager of <Bond Corp International Ltd> in Hong Kong, told Reuters the Atlas statement on the negotiations was "reasonably accurate."     Banks said Bond Corp was seriously considering several investments in the Philippines but did not give details.     In its statement, Atlas said development of the pre-World War Two underground mines in Masbate had been accelerated and the ore tonnage had increased, extending the operation's life at least until 1993.

TEST; 8-APR-1987 06:44:25.79;ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - KUWAITI ECONOMY;     By Rory Channing, Reuters Kuwait's oil-reliant and debt-ridden economy has started to pull out of a nosedive but oil prices will determine the pace of recovery, bankers and economists say.     Crucial will be the ability of the 13-member OPEC to hold oil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in the northern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens.     Bankers estimate the economy, measured in terms of gross domestic product (gdp), shrank 19 pct in real terms last year after contracting 8.1 pct the year before.     This was after taking into account inflation in consumer prices of 1.5 pct in 1985, slowing to 1.0 pct in 1986.     Factors depressing economic activity include the 6-1/2-year-old Iran-Iraq war on Kuwait's doorstep, which threatens the emirate's vital oil export lifeline through the Gulf and has sapped business confidence.     But sentiment received a much-needed boost in September when, after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisis caused by the 1982 crash of local stock market, a comprehensive new debt settlement program was introduced.     The share crash, result of a speculative spree in forward trading, left 95 billion dlrs of post-dated cheques in default.     The cheques were also used as collateral for consumer spending, thus generating an informal credit system.     Much of the debt has been watered down but big sums are still owed by individuals and companies.     There was some 4.4 billion dinars (about 15.7 billion dlrs) in outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986, of which one-quarter to one-third was estimated by bankers to rank as bad or doubtful debt. But the government has repeatedly said it will not allow any banks to go under.     The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling of problem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whether debtors have regular cash flows or not.     Banks' shareholders and depositors will have their rights guaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significance in a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sector is the biggest after oil.     Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to ride out the oil glut, bankers and economists say.     Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels per day (bpd) compared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned last year by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah.     But strategic diversification into downstream operations in Europe several years ago and a hefty refining investment at home gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sell over one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products.     Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average 2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processed product such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than as crude.     Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reason for cautious optimism. Other reasons are low domestic inflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recent years and signs government spending on productive sectors will remain steady.     External accounts are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8 billion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct below that for 1985, but still an achievement in the recession-hit Gulf.     Kuwait's petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were put officially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment income of the equivalent of about 3.65 billion dlrs a year.     But for the first time since the end of the oil boom, these reserves may not be enough to prevent a "real" budget deficit for the 1986/87 fiscal year ending June 30, bankers say.     In a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary, revenues for 1986/87 were cut 38.6 pct and spending 11 pct, doubling the nominal deficit to 1.33 billion dinars.     This left out income from state reserves, usually excluded in official budget accounting, which are forecast by bankers at up to 1.0 billion dinars in 1986/87, resulting in some shortfall.     Bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast for economic growth this year or next.     "It depends on oil prices," one said. "This summer is important."     Cabinet Affairs Minister Rashid al-Rashid said last Sunday the cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise state spending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate the economy.     He gave no details but bankers say these are expected to be spelled out in the 1987/88 budget, possibly in June.  REUTER ;
TEST; 8-APR-1987 06:50:05.68;MALAYSIA MAY NOT MEET 1987 OIL PALM TARGET;  Malaysia is unlikely to meet its targeted output of five mln tonnes of oil palm in calendar 1987, oil palm growers told Reuters.     Output in 1987 is expected to reach around 4.5 mln tonnes, unchanged from 1986, because of drought, low use of fertiliser and overstressed palms, they said.     The growers were asked for their reaction to an Oil World newsletter report that Malaysia's oil palm output is likely to drop sharply this year.     Palm oil now sells at around 700 ringgit a tonne, or about 115 ringgit less than soybean oil, but Malaysia must sell more palm oil to prevent a stock buildup that could damage the industry, a leading grower told Reuters.     The country's palm oil stocks now total some 500,000 tonnes against about 800,000 last March, the growers said.     The growers expect palm oil prices to ease later this year due to pressure from South American and U.S. Soybean output.     The current South American oilseed harvest, mainly soybean, is likely to be around 25.7 mln tonnes against the previous 21.7 mln tonne crop, they said.     In addition, new U.S. Soybean plantings are also expected to enter the market around November when Malaysian palm oil output peaks.     They said new planting of palms is also likely to slow, with some 50,000 hectares expected to be planted with new trees against 100,000 in 1986, although the effects of this reduction will not be felt for about another three years.

TEST; 8-APR-1987 10:58:23.92;REPORT SEEKS TO DISALLOW SOUTHERN <SO> COSTS;  An audit submitted to the Georgia Public Service Commission claims that between 944 mln dlrs and 1.8 billion dlrs of the costs of the Plant Vogtle nuclear power station should be disallowed, a Southern Co spokeswoman said.     Southern's Georgia Power Co subsidiary has a 45.7 pct interest in the plant and estimated earlier this year it would cost a total of 8.87 billion dlrs. Last year, the plant's owners pledged to Georgia regulators they would limit the cost passed on to rate payers to 8.4 billion dlrs.     The Southern spokeswoman said the company feels the report by O'Brien-Kreitzberg is "flawed and biased." She said the report was released yesterday by the state attorney general.     Responding to the report today, Georgia Power Chairman Robert W. Scherer told a news conference the conclusions drawn by the firm "are not only wrong -- they also reflect the same bias against nuclear power that these auditors have demonstrated in similar cases accross the country."     Saying he was not suggesting Georgia power was without fault, Scherer said "the audit identified several things I wish we had done differently."     Scherer pointed out a report O'Brien-Kreitzberg submitted to Georgia regulators in March 1986 projected Georgia Power would not finish Plant Vogtle unit one before the end of 1987.     Noting "unit one is finished, and we expect it to be in commercial operationg by June," he said the firm's latest report ignored the earlier projection, gave the utility no credit for the completion and "actually penalized us by suggesting that costs to maintain t he schedule be disallowed."     Scherer said the latest audit alleges Georgia Power could have saved 95 mln dlrs if it had stopped using four shifts, seven days a week to speed construction three years sooner.     He said this would have delayed completion of the plant for another year "and it would have cost several hunderd million dlrs more."     Noting the audit said costs were increased 600 mln dlrs by schedule delays totaling 20.5 months, he said "First, we have the best concrete placement record in the industry, Second new government regulations after the Three Mile Island incident significantly increased construction time.

Agrimont, still wholly owned by Montedison, is taking steps to be traded on the Milan exchange, the company said.     The company said that 1986 was characterized by an unstable fertlizer market due to the weak dollar and the decline of international prices for products sold in Europe and the U.S where Agrimont operates through its Conserv division.

Lee Everett said.     The Nuclear Regulatory Commission ordered the utility to close the plant early last week.     "This is the first time an operating plant has been shut down by the NRC specifically because of plant operator problems," Everett told the company's annual meeting.     He did not say who would pay for the replacement power -- rate payers or shareholders.     Everett told the meeting Philadelphia Electric can not give a definitive answer on the cost of the shutdown until it gets Peach Bottom back in service.     He said the utility had been aware for some time it had attitude problems among the operating forces at Peach Bottom and thought it had been making progress toward improvement.     "While the attitude of operating personnel at Peach Bottom has been rated poor, the attitudes or our personnel at Limerick, our other nuclear plant, have been rated excellent. We have asked ourselves over and over how two plants, managed by the same company, can be so different."     Everett said "Limerick has been the model for improvements we set out to accomplish at Peach Bottom, and remains so."     He said a special committee composed of Philadelphia Electric's outside directors will monitor and direct the company's investigation of the problem.  Reuter ;
TEST; 8-APR-1987 14:01:31.06;MEDTRONIC <MDT> SEES 15 PCT EARNINGS GROWTH;  Medtronic Inc said it sees 15 pct growth in sales and earnings for the year ending April 30, 1988.     At an analysts meeting here the company said that for the year ending April 30, 1987 it will earn about 73 mln dlrs, or about 5.15-5.35 dlrs a share on sales of about 500 mln dlrs.     In the year ago period, the company earned 53.4 mln dlrs, or 3.65 dlrs a share, on sales of 402.8 mln dlrs.     Winston Wallin, Medtronic chairman, said the company will improve market share in fiscal 1988 in cardiac pacemakers and expand its cardiovascular therapeutic product line.     Wallin cautioned analysts not to quickly change their per share estimates for the company as he said Medtronic will have heavy sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 1988.     He said the company intends to reinvest its earnings in its businesses and not in its dividends. "Shareholders are better off if we grow the business rather than reinvest in dividends or share repurchases," he said.     Wallin said he sees Medtronic's share of the total worldwide pacemaker market increasing to 42 pct in fiscal 1988, from 40 pct in fiscal 1987.     He said the worldwide market for cardiovascualr therapeutic products, which includes pacemakers, valves, catheters and lasers, will be valued at about 2.5 billion dlrs 1990 and will double that by 1995.     Wallin said, "Our objective is to get a hold of new products and start building market share if we have to beg, borrow or steal to get into new markets."     In the past, Medtronic's pacemakers have been plagued with a number of problems leading to product recalls. Regulators also have criticized the industry, citing quality problems and a needless overprescription of pacemakers.     "We have no knowledge of any major problems in our pacemakers or leads," Wallin said. "We intend to re-establish our company as the quality leader in the industry."     Glen Nelson, executive vice president for Medtronics, said the company intends to diversify internally and through acquisitions of companies in areas of Medtronic's expertise, such as drug delivery systems.     Wallin said the 15 pct earnings growth for fiscal 1988 does not include dilutions from acquisitions. "We hope to have some safety provisions so that we won't have any major dilutions from an acquisition."     Wallin also said the company will have virtual exclusivity in rate responsive pacemakers for all of fiscal 1988.     The company markets Activitrax, the first single chamber pacemaker that varies heartrate in response to physical activity.     Siemens AG, a West German company, is also developing a rate responsive pacemaker.      Reuter ;

Airbus said yesterday that it chosen the CFM56-5-S3 engine, to be produced by <General Electric> of the U.S. And <SNECMA of France, because the <International Aero Engine> (IAE) high technology superfan engine would not be ready by early 1992, when the A340 plane is due to become operational.     The five-nation IAE consortium has decided not to go ahead with the proposed launch of the superfan, a spokesman for consortium member <Rolls-Royce Plc> said today, adding that the project had not been cancelled and could be offered later on.     Airbus said the CFM56-5-S3 will have a thrust of 30,600 lbs and an improved fuel burn of four per cent compared with the CFM56-5A1 which is now being operated on the A320 flight-test aircraft. It will be available for deliveries of the A340 in May 1992.     At the same time, the Airbus statement said Airbus Industrie and General Electric have concluded an accord for an improved version of the GE CF6-80C2 engine, with 64,000 lbs of thrust and a three per cent improvement in specific fuel consumption, to power the A330 aircraft which will be introduced in spring 1993.     "This continues the long-standing history of all Airbus launches being made with either GE or CFMI engines," Airbus Industrie president Jean Pierson said in the statement.     "Airbus Industrie has already worked with CFMI to launch one new aircraft programme - the A320 - in early 1984, and is happy to build on this relationship by launching the A340 with an improved version of the same engine," Pierson said.

TEST; 8-APR-1987 17:37:24.16;DEFICIT CUTS SEEN UNABLE TO CURE TRADE DEFICIT;     By Irwin Arieff Financial analysts say they are pleased with congressional moves to trim next year's federal budget deficit but believe the actions will do little to help improve the U.S. trade deficit or buoy the economy.     The House of Representatives is expected to vote tomorrow to approve a trillion-dollar budget blueprint for the coming fiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs.     Similarly, the Senate Budget Committee has approved a plan that would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs next year.         "In terms of the economy, 37-38 billion dlrs is infinitesimal, so cuts of this magnitude will have little impact on the economy and the trade deficit," said Stanley Collander, a Touche Ross federal budget policy analyst.     "At best, it will have a small positive effect," Collander said in an interview.     Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker has repeatedly told Congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long way to help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help ease some of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar.     The U.S. government has attempted to remedy the trade imbalance by driving down the value of the dollar. But Volcker has warned that a further fall in the dollar's value is fraught with danger.     Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation as imported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign capital needed to finance the federal budget deficit.     In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with other major industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value of the dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates should be stabilized at around current levels.     As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed to take steps to stimulate their economies and the United States agreed to cut its budget deficit.     The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a way to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, is to reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending.     "If you don't deal with the budget deficit, everything else you do is going to be counterproductive," Volcker said in recent testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.     Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the government's purse strings than have the Fed tighten the credit supply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or to assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the United States.     Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off the current modest economic expansion and threaten a recession.     Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressed that any deficit reduction was better than none.     But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were  not enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility it needs to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar from plunging further in world exchange markets.     "There's no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but if your objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the Fed's flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answer is, it's not enough," Silvia told Reuters.     The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government's most vexing and persistent problems.     The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yet little indication that this year's figure will be any lower, though administration officials have predicted it will drop by about 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year's end.     In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleep worrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from the federal budget.     On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is not attached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for the 1986-1991 period by last year's Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law.     While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for next year's federal deficit, both the House and Senate Budget Committees have conceded that their budget plans would fall short of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs.     "For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the most you're going to get" out of Congress at the present time, said Touche Ross's Collander. "To do something more than that would be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult."     Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end up short of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels.     "To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptable reduction level," he explained. "Anything less than that will now look like a failure to Wall Street."     The budget plan now under debate on the House floor would lower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the year beginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cutting defense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from their anticipated spending levels for next year.     The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit of nearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in new  taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts.  Reuter ;

TEST; 8-APR-1987 17:57:03.82;FUNARO SAYS BRAZIL'S CREDITORS MUST TRUST HIM;  Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro, who suspended interest payments to creditor banks two months ago, said creditors had to trust him when he said Brazil would achieve a trade surplus large enough to continue servicing its debt.     Speaking to reporters at the Brazilian Embassy, Funaro said he would not seek approval of Brazil's economic program outside his country, but added, "At the same time we show credibility, you (the banks) are going to have to trust us."     Asked if creditor banks would accept Brazil's refinancing needs based on a new economic program not endorsed by the International Monetary Fund, Funaro said, "What other options do they have?...They have to try to see our program."     Funaro, who is in Washington to attend the Interim Committee and Development Committee meetings of the World Bank and IMF, said he unveiled his refinancing proposals to the major creditor banks in New York yesterday.     According to Funaro, the creditor banks "agreed on the need to find a solution to the crisis." He did not elaborate.     Funaro said the commercial banks agreed on Brazil's need for economic growth and added that creditors were aware that Brazil cannot continue to export the 24 billion dlrs in net capital that it transferred over the past three years.     He also said that he told bankers about Brazil's needs to ensure a seven pct average growth and eight billion to 11 billion dlr trade surplus until 1991.     Administration officials familiar with the negotiations said Brazil's new economic measures did not make much sense based on current conditions in that country, and added that they saw long and difficult negotiations ahead.     Lewis Preston, chairman of J.P. Morgan and Co. Inc., told Reuters he remains hopeful that Brazil and its foreign bank creditors will reach a debt rescheduling agreement before the end of the year.     But Preston, who did not attend the meeting between Funaro and creditor banks yesterday, added the onus is still on Brazil to put its economic house in order first.     "They haven't even come up with a plan yet," Preston said after Morgan's annual meeting in New York today.     Funaro, however, said most creditor banks had representatives in Brazil who were well aware of Brazil's new economic measures, designed to curb a surge in inflation and spending and a sharp drop in exports.     Funaro called Brazil's program very responsible and very strong, adding that "it is very different from other years, there has been a tremendous change."     Based on Brazil's current economic situation - suspension of interest payments on 67 billion dlrs owed to banks, 200 pct inflation and the need of four billion dlrs in new loans every year until 1991 - he said he was faced with two options.

TEST; 8-APR-1987 18:00:34.46;BUNDESBANK CALLS FOR CENTRAL BANK COOPERATION;  Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler called on central banks of major industrialised nations to cooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies.     In a lecture at the University of Surrey, pre-released here, Koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was protectionism and control on capital movements.     "Central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have them," he said. He added that West German growth forecasts would have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop to 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987.     Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets had parted company with transactions in goods, services and investments. It was the scale of speculative transactions that determined market trends.     Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to grow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rates would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off.     "In other words, the monetary policy measures required are different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to -- those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of mounting economic activity," Koehler said.     The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S. Current account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciation going by talking the dollar down posed problems.     The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep rise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the cost of European imports. But the volume effect of falling imports to the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time to make itself felt compared with the price effect.     "Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going further than would be necessary to adjust the current account over the medium term," Koehler said.     A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occur only if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand. In Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand should rise faster than GNP.     "In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986," Koehler said.     If a further appreciation of the dollar was to be prevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset by an inflow of foreign funds into the U.S..     But only if there was an appropriate interest rate differential would Europe and Japan look for financial investment in the U.S.     When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bank had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions.     Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market and its substantial impact on exchange rates.     It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of price stability, economic growth and full employment but also to tackle international problems like the exchange rate problem, the debt problem and the current account problem.     A strategy had to be designed that helped "the safeguarding of non-inflationary economic growth in an international monetary system largely free of disruptions," Koehler said.     Given the system of floating exchange rates, it was necessary for central banks to agree to intervene. It sufficed to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over the next few years and intervention points should not be set, because they were only testing points for the market, he said.     In order to keep the international monetary system free of disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but also cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said.  REUTER ;

The finance ministers and central bank governors of seven major industrial countries met today.     They continued the process of multilateral surveillance of their economies pursuant to the arrangements for strengthened economic policy coordination agreed at the 1986 Tokyo summit of their heads of state or government.     The managing director of the International Monetary Fund also participated in the meeting.     2. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting, and noted the progress achieved in implementing the undertakings embodied in the Louvre Agreement.     They agreed, however, that further actions will be essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain global economic expansion, and reduce trade imbalances.     In this connection they welcomed the proposals just announced by the governing Liberal Democratic Party in Japan for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate Japan's economy through early implementation of a large supplementary budget exceeding those of previous years, as well as unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.     The government of Japan reaffirmed its intention to further open up its domestic markets to foreign goods and services.     3. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that around current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.     In that connection they welcomed the strong implementation of the Louvre Agreement.     They concluded that present and prospective progress in implementing the policy undertakings at the Louvre and in this statement provided a basis for continuing close cooperation to foster the stability of exchange rates.

Mahlmann earlier told a press conference he would visit Kyoji Kitamura, director-general of the Finance Ministry's Securities Bureau, to express the CBOT's concern that Japanese financial institutions and individuals are not permitted to trade on the CBOT. Mahlmann is on a two-week tour of Hong Kong, Tokyo and Sydney.     Mahlmann urged Japan to boost Tokyo's status as a world financial center by promoting the internationalisation of its financial industry.     The Finance Ministry is expected to allow local banks, securities houses and insurance companies to use overseas markets from this month, bond market sources said, but officials would only say the issue was under study.     Initially, the ministry is likely to bar corporate and individual investors due to their relative inexperience, and to limit trading to instruments like currency, stock indexes, time deposits and government debt futures, the sources said.     Mahlmann told reporters the CBOT will start evening trading to coincide with Far East morning activity on April 30. But he added night sessions would not preclude the CBOT from forming links with Far Eastern exchanges, although nothing had been decided.     Asked what type of financial futures would be appropriate, he cited products concerning debt and equity.     The CBOT evening session will run from 6:00 to 9:00 P.M. Chicago time (2300 to 0200 GMT), which is 8:00 to 11:00 A.M. In Tokyo, and trading will be limited to four contracts -- U.S. Treasury note and bond futures and options, he said.     Yen bond dealers said a proposed link between CBOT and the London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE), combined with yen bond futures listings on both, would multiply volume if trade was encouraged by Tokyo-based orders.     Healthy liquidity growth in cash yen bond markets overseas is a prerequisite for expanded futures trading, traders said.     LIFFE plans to list yen bond futures should go ahead from September, possibly coinciding with the CBOT, traders said.     The CBOT applied for permission to offer a long-term Japanese government bond futures contract on March 17, and the authorities must rule on the request within a year.  REUTER ;

The firm's suit alleges that Lotus' spreadsheet program 1-2-3 violates the copyright of VisiCalc, which was developed by SAPC several years ago, before 1-2-3 was introduced, when the firm was known as Software Arts Inc.  Software Arts sold rights to VisiCalc to Lotus in 1985 and changed its name.     The suit also alleges that Lotus founder Mitchell D. Kapor, who resigned as chairman in July 1986, breached a confidentiality agreement with SAPC.  Kapor, also named as a defendant, had worked for a firm that had marketing rights to VisiCalc before founding Lotus.     The suit alleges that Lotus and Kapor deliberately sought to make 1-2-3 look and feel like VisiCalc by copying a number of commands, keystrokes and screen displays.     Lotus, in response, said it feels the suit is without merit.  Reuter ;

The Commission had also written to seven other Community airlines, including British Airways <BAB.L> and Air France, last summer warning them that agreements such as capacity and revenue sharing accords broke EC competition rules. The seven have already agreed to hold talks with the Commission on bringing such practices into line with the rules.     In a statement, the EC's executive authority also spelled out tough demands it will be putting to carriers in talks on liberalising EC air transport and bringing down airfares, warning that new legal moves were possible if they refused to comply.     As a first step, the Commission wanted the 10 carriers to eliminate the most serious distortions of competition caused by the current practices and agreements.     The latest demands go further towards liberalisation than proposals that are currently the subject of difficult negotiations between by EC Transport Ministers. REUTER ;

TEST; 9-APR-1987 09:36:38.77;CHINA LIKELY TO JOIN GATT, DIPLOMATS SAY;  China is likely to succeed in joining GATT despite policies that contradict free trade, because western countries support its entry, western diplomats said.     China applied to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in July 1986. The organisation, formed in 1948 to integrate the world's free market economies, now regulates 80 pct of world trade.     The GATT secretariat is expected to submit a list of detailed questions to China next month at the start of long and complex entry negotiations, the diplomats said.     One diplomat said China's prospects are good, with its application supported by the United States, Japan and the European Community for political and economic reasons.     "The fear is that if China was refused entry, it would draw back the bamboo curtain and go back to the way it was," he said.     Another said the Soviet Union was waiting in the wings.     "If GATT accepted China, it would be hard not to accept the Soviet Union," he said. "China's agreement will be seen as a model for the Soviet Union. GATT is not a political body."     But serious problems have to be tackled during the talks, including China's pricing system and trade subsidies.     GATT is based on free trade and aims to lower tariffs and promote trade, with prices alone dictating who buys what.     One diplomat said it was very hard in China to establish the real cost of goods because many prices are set by the state and often contain subsidies.  Reuter ;

TEST; 9-APR-1987 10:38:57.84;UK, FRANCE TO URGE DEBT RELIEF FOR POOREST LANDS;     By Peter Torday, Reuters Britain, France and other European nations will make a strong plea in high-level meetings today for urgent debt relief for the very poorest countries, European monetary sources said.     The request will be put to the International Monetary Fund's policy-making Interim Committee, which meets here as part of semi-annual IMF and World Bank talks.     But it is likely to run into opposition from the United States, which regards debt relief, even for the world's poorest nations in Sub-Saharan Africa, with distaste.     "If all creditors agreed, (Britain and France) would be prepared to consider below market interest rates " for the countries, one source said.     A senior U.S. Treasury official poured cold water on the plan earlier this week, however. "We are not willing to enter into arrangements that would forgive debt or provide concessional interest rates," the official said.     At the heart of the American objection is the fear that once such a concession is made for the very poorest nations, then sooner or later Latin debtors will be demanding similar relief.     African nations owe foreign creditors, most of them governments, over 70 billion dlrs. Over 21 billion dlrs is debt owed by poorest Sub-Saharan African nations.     In addition to interest rate concessions, the sources said European countries wanted repayment of these loans to be stretched out for up to 20 years, with a substantial delay before capital repayments start.     The issue was inconclusively discussed in yesterday's meetings of the major industrial nations -- the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.     It is already under consideration by the Paris Club of western creditor nations, to which the United States belongs.     "There are quite obviously differences about it," one source said of the American attitude. "But it is perfectly clear that (debt repayment) is an abiding problem for a small number of the poorest countries."     The plan would also involve the conversion of bilateral aid to these countries into outright grants, a policy already adopted by Paris and London. REUTER^M ;

In remarks before the IMF's policy-making Interim Committee, Baker reiterated a Group of Seven statement last night that the substantial exchange rate changes since the Plaza agreement 18 months ago have "now brought currencies within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals."     Baker said, "These exchange rate shifts have generally been orderly, and have improved prospects for the reduction of external imbalances to more sustainable levels."     As they are today, the trade and current account imbalances "simply are not sustainable," Baker told the ministers.     He said that the Reagan administration was resisting "strong domestic pressure" for trade protection and was working closely with the U.S. Congress in crafting a trade bill.     "While we cannot yet be sure of the outcome, we are doing what we can to ensure that the bill is not protectionist," he said.     Baker also urged the International Monetary Fund's executive board to review possible modifications to the Fund's compensatory financing facility before the annual meeting this fall.     "We should pay particular attention to the lack of continuing conditionality associated with the use of the CFF and to whether shortfalls in export earnings are indeed temporary," he said.  Reuter ;

The committee also voted for legally-binding quantity and quality requirements on the materials, mostly metals.     The measures are a part of the Defense Authorization Bill which will be voted on in the House next month.     The purpose of the measures, passed by the committee yesterday, is to improve stockpile management and discourage sell-offs of materials that could jeopardize strategic needs, a staff member of the committee told Reuters.     "They (the stockpiles) stand to gain the most by being managed properly," said the staffer. "Management of the stockpile over the last 10 years has been atrocious."     Responsibility for stockpile management now belongs to a White House agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency.     The staffer said that under the measures passed by the committee the Secretary of Defense would have more influence over decisions to keep or sell strategic stockpile materials.     The administration has proposed a goal of 700 million dlrs worth of strategic materials to be held in the stockpile. The stockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials.     He said several agencies currently helped FEMA to manage the stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit.     These agencies included the Office of Management and Budget and the Departments of Interior and Commerce, he said.     The committee believed the shared involvement in stockpile management was counter-productive, he said.  Reuter ;

TEST; 9-APR-1987 15:30:40.85;SOVIET UNION TO IMPORT MORE GRAIN IN 86/87-USDA;  The U.S. Agriculture Department increased its estimate of 1986/87 grain purchases by the Soviet Union to 28 mln tonnes, up two mln tonnes from last month.     In its monthly report on the Soviet grain situation, the USDA said imports will be higher than earlier estimated because Soviet grain buyers have been actively purchasing in the last month.     USDA said the increased purchasing is "somewhat surprising" because of recent higher Soviet crop estimates.     All of the increase in estimated imports will be in corn, USDA said.     Of the 28 mln tonnes total, 15 mln tonnes will be wheat, 12 mln tonnes coarse grains, and the remaining one mln tonnes miscellaneous grains and pulses, USDA said.     USDA noted that the Soviet winter grain crop suffered through a severe winter and spring field work has been delayed.     The severe winter "is believed to have resulted in above average winter-kill," USDA said.     Some grain trade analysts have said abnormal winter losses maybe one reason why the Soviet Union has been actively buying grain recently.     USDA said Moscow already has purchased over 25 mln tonnes grain for delivery in 1986/87, including 14 mln tonnes wheat and 12 mln tonnes coarse grain.  Reuter ;

The firmer tone to refining margins in Europe and the U.S. relected higher prices for petroleum products, particularly gasoline, and support from crude oil prices.     Netback values for crude oil refined in Northern Europe rose substantially following strong gains in gasoline prices there.

In the U.S. Gulf, sweet crudes rose in value by 14 cts to 19.33 dlrs for West Texas Intermediate, up about 0.7 pct.     Sour grades in the U.S. Gulf showed an increase of 33 cts a barrel for Alaska North Slope, up 1.7 pct.     But netbacks for crude oil refined in Singapore fell sharply, down 15 cts to as much as 68 cts a barrel as ample distillate supplies weighed on petroleum product prices.     Attaka in Singapore is valued at 18.55 dlrs, a decline of 68 cts a barrel or 3.5 pct from the previous week.

TEST; 9-APR-1987 17:04:00.71;TREASURY'S BAKER SAYS SYSTEM NEEDS STABILITY;  Treasury Secretary James Baker said the floating exchange rate system has not been as effective as had been hoped in promoting stability and preventing imbalances from emerging in the global economy.     In remarks before the afternoon session of the International Monetary Fund's Interim Committee, Baker said he was not suggesting that the system should be abandoned.     "But I do suggest," he said, "that we need something to give it more stability and to keep it headed in the right direction when the wind shifts."     He said that indicators can serve "as a kind of compass" but added that structural indicators can help focus attention on some policies.     Baker, however, said the IMF "needs to move beyond macroeconomic indicators and find structural indicators that can help focus attention on some of the policies of specific relevance to the imbalances we face today."     The Treasury Secretary said that indicators should be given a more prominent role in the annual economic reviews -- Article IV consultations -- that the Fund performs.     Baker also told the policy making group that it was time for the IMF to adopt earlier recommendations making IMF surveillance more relevant to national policymakers and the public.     "In particular, we urge increased publicity for IMF appraisals developed in Article IV consultations, the use of follow-up reports on country actions to implement IMF recommendations, and greater use of special consultation procedures," he said.     Baker emphasized that indicators were a device "for moving beyond rhetoric to action."     He said they provide "more structure to the system, and induce more discipline and peer pressure into the process of policy coordination."     He said the Fund's procedures for surveillance need to be reviewed and updated to reflect the use of indicators.     "This should be matter of priority for the executive board," he said.     Baker also urged the Fund to develop alternative medium-term economic scenarios for countries that "can help us focus even more clearly on the most important imbalances, by identifying options for addressing them and analyzing the implications of these options."     He said also that further work should be done on finding paths that lead toward possible medium-term objectives.     "If we are to take effective remedial action when there are significant deviations from an intended course, then we must have more definitive ways of indentifying the right course for key variables," he said.

TEST; 9-APR-1987 17:52:21.04;SEMICONDUCTOR BOOK TO BILL RATIO AT 1.21 PCT;  The Semiconductor Industry Association put the three-month average book-to-bill ratio at 1.21, which was above analysts' expectations and reflects the sixth straight increase in this indicator of computer industry activity.     Average booking in the three month period ended in March totaled 910.8 mln dlrs, up 15.6 pct from a month ago and the highest bookings since September, 1984. March billings, or computer chip sales in the month, totaled 912.1 mln dlrs, up 34.6 pct from a month ago, the association said. The three month average billings totaled 751.3 mln dlrs, up 6.5 pct.     March billings were the strongest recorded since November, 1984, the association said. The book to bill ratio, at 1.21, was the highest since May, 1984, it noted.     Preliminary total solid state shipments for the first quarter of 1987 totaled 2.25 billion dlrs, up 4.9 pct from last quarter and up 15.9 pct from last year's first quarter.     Semiconductor Industry Association President Andrew Procassini said the rise in the book to bill was due to a substantial increase in U.S. bookings during March.     "We believe that the bookings increase reflects growing confidence by electronic equipment manufacturers that some end-equipment market segments have improved substantially during the first quarter," Procassini said in a statement.     The association also revised its book-to-bill ratio estimate for the three months ended in February to 1.12, from 1.13 earlier. It further revised the January book-to-bill figure to 1.09 from 1.12 estimated earlier.     The three-month average book-to-bill ratio of 1.21 for March means for every 100 dlrs worth of product shipped, computer chip maker received 121 dlrs in new orders.     Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc analyst Michael Gumport said association numbers indicate March orders were up 20 pct above the normal seasonal level.     The association does not break out March orders from its three-month average, which it put at 910.8 mln dlrs.     Gumport noted the three-month average bookings were well above the 800-865 mln dlrs anticipated by the industry.     He said semiconductor stock could rise five to ten pct on the stock market open tomorrow, due to the positive numbers.     "Skeptics are going to have to have some pretty strong reasons not to like this group (of stocks)," Gumport said.     Kidder Peabody and Co analyst Michael Kubiak said the ratio indicates March orders at about one billion dlrs, which would be the highest monthly order rate since April, 1984.     He predicted at least a five pct rise in semiconductor stocks on the open, and said the stock group could soar as high as 15 pct during the session.     "One month does not a boom-time make, but this is very good news," he said.     Kubiak attributed the stong semiconductor orders to strength in the personal computer market, inventory restocking and strong buying by distributors.     Purchasing managers had been keeping computer chip inventories low, due to the overcapacity in the industry and the slow growth of the economy in general, analysts noted.     The semiconductor industry has been in a slump for the past three years.     The analysts said the March order and sales numbers are the strongest evidence yet that the trend may be turning.     Nevertheless, they do not expect the Administration to retreat from proposed sanctions against Japanese chip makers.     They added, however, if the industry continues to improve, it could mean the sanctions will be short term.     Jack Beedle, President of In-Stat, an electronics industry research firm, called the March numbers "excellent", but also cautioned against excessive optimism.     "I still believe caution should be the word, rather than euphoria," said Beedle, adding that he has yet to see strong indications from the general economy or the computer industry that support a solid, long-term recovery.     Beedle said while he thinks the semiconductor industry will have a very good second quarter, he still thinks positive shifts in exports and industrial production are needed to sustain a recovery.

TEST; 9-APR-1987 18:42:19.11;ANALYSTS DOUBT FED FIRMED DESPITE BORROWING RISE;     By Martin Cherrin, Reuters Economists said that they doubt the Federal Reserve is firming policy to aid the dollar, despite higher discount window borrowings in the latest two-week statement period and very heavy borrowings Wednesday.     Data out today show net borrowings from the Fed averaged 393 mln dlrs in the two weeks to Wednesday, up from 265 mln dlrs in the prior statement period. Wednesday borrowings were 1.4 billion dlrs as Federal funds averaged a high 6.45 pct.     "One could make a case that the Fed is firming, but it probably isn't," said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds.     Sullivan said some may assume the Fed has firmed policy modestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in the two-weeks to Wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averaging around 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months.     However, the Dean Witter economist noted that the latest two-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demand often pushes up borrrowings.     "Some might argue that the Fed was firming policy, but it looks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisions late in the statement period and didn't quite make it," said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.     A Fed spokesman told a press press conference today that the Fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs or more in its reserve projections in the week ended Wednesday.     Still, McCarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss in its estimates over the week that caused it to add fewer reserves earlier in the week than were actually needed.     The Fed took no market reserve management action last Thursday and Friday, the first two days of the week. It added temporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements and then supplied reserves directly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday.     Based on Fed data out today, economists calculated that the two-day System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged on Tuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs. They put Wednesday's overnight System repos at approximately 3.4 billion dlrs.     "It is quite clear that the Fed is not firming policy at this time," said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.     Citing the view shared by the other two economists, Leuzzi said the Fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interest rates to help the dollar because that would harm already weak economies in the United States and abroad and add to the financial stress of developing countries and their lenders.     "Those who believe the Fed tightened policy in the latest statement period have to explain why it acted before the dollar tumbled," said McCarthy of Merrill Lynch.     He said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a new statement period began today on disappointment yesterday's Washington meetings of international monetary officials failed to produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid.     In fact, currency dealers said there was nothing in Wednesday's G-7 communique to alter the prevailing view that the yen needs to rise further to redress the huge trade imbalance between the United States and Japan.     The economists generally agreed that the Fed is aiming for steady policy now that should correspond to a weekly average Fed funds rate between six and 6-1/8 pct. This is about where the rate has been since early November.     "I'm not so sure that the Fed is engineering a tighter policy to help the dollar, as some suspect," said Sullivan of Dean Witter.     If it is, however, he said that Fed probably has just nudged up its funds rate goal to around 6.25 to 6.35 pct from six to 6.10 pct previously.  Reuter ;

TEST; 9-APR-1987 23:37:51.92;SWISS BANKER SAYS COUNTRIES SEEK NEW DEBT ANSWERS;  Countries meeting at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) this week are looking at a variety of new ways to resolve the problem of third world debt, Swiss National Bank president Pierre Languetin said.     Languetin said meetings of the Group of 10 and the IMF Interim Committee today reached a consensus that a rescheduling like that of Mexico's debt must be the last of its kind. The Mexico rescheduling has still not been finally resolved six months after it started. Various members suggested other options to break the deadlock between debtor countries and their creditors, he said.     Languetin said no recommendations were agreed, but he listed some of the suggestions.     One involved individual banking systems each resolving the problem of small banks which refused to participate in reschedulings. It was this problem that had prevented completion of the Mexican rescheduling, he said.     Debt-equity swaps could be expanded, as could 'on-lending', which some banks had proposed for Argentine debt. 'On-lending' allows banks to select customers for rescheduled amounts.     Small banks which did not wish to reschedule might be forced to sign "exit bonds," prohibiting them from lending to that country again, he said.     Languetin said none of these represented a general view. But he added "People are trying to get out of the corset."  REUTER ;

The official MTI news agency said the government decided consumer price subsidies had to be cut to reduce state spending. From today the price of meat will rise by an average 18 pct and that of beer and spirits by 10 pct, MTI said.     MTI said consumer goods will also become more expensive, with the price of refrigerators rising some five pct. It also announced a number of measures to ease hardship, including higher pensions and family allowances.     Statistics indicate the budget deficit tripled in 1986 to 47 billion forints. Central banker Janos Fekete has said the Finance Ministry is trying to cut the 1987 shortfall to between 30 and 35 billion from a planned 43.8 billion.     A major tax reform, including the introduction of a Western-style valued added tax, is planned for January 1988 in an effort to cure problems in state spending.     But diplomats said the latest announcement shows the authorities were forced to act quickly to keep this year's deficit under control.     The measures are also aimed at cooling an overheated economy, and could help dampen Hungarians' appetite for imported Western goods which consume increasingly expensive hard currency, the diplomats said.     The diplomats also said, however, that they did not expect the kind of social unrest that followed sharp price rises in other East Bloc states, notably Poland.  REUTER ;
TEST;13-APR-1987 04:05:06.87;OFFER FOR DOME MAY SHORT-CIRCUIT ITS DEBT TALKS;     By Larry Welsh, Reuters A 3.22 billion dlr offer for Dome Petroleum Ltd <DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd <TRP.TO> may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the door for more takeover bids, oil analysts said.     Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer substantial payments to creditors will expire.     Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholders that an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan.     Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as public noteholders in March after several months of delicate negotiations.     TransCanada's proposal "amounts to a quasi debt restructuring," oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker Ltd said from Toronto.     Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allow creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.     "The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations," said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in Calgary.     TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed refinancing packages, Gobert said.     The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders to agree to a restructuring, he added.     "I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain any and all offers (for Dome)," Gobert said.     Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that TransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other possible buyers from making an offer. "By drawing attention to us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little reluctant to come forward," he said.     Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formal offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a confidential agreement between the two companies, he said.     Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other unidentified parties. However, Dome said its management and financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including TransCanada's.     Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair price for the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings.     However, he said not enough financial details are known about Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of TransCanada's proposed offer.  REUTER ;
TEST;13-APR-1987 04:33:05.29;TEXACO <TX> EUROBONDS UNQUOTED AT MARKET OPENING;  Eurobonds for Texaco Inc subsidiaries were unquoted this morning as traders assessed the implications of the company's shock weekend decision to file for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of U.S. Bankruptcy laws, eurobond dealers said.     The decision to file for bankruptcy follows a court decision that it had to post an 11 billion dlr bond to continue its court battles with Pennzoil Co <PZL>.     One head trader at a U.S. Securities house said, "I don't want to be obstructive, but there genuinely is no market in Texaco bonds at the moment. Everyone is stunned by the decision (to file for bankruptcy) and can't really believe it."     One dealer noted that Texaco subsidiaries have outstanding eurobonds totalling over three billion dlrs out of total borrowings of some 6.8 billion dlrs.     He added that many of the fixed interest eurobonds - dollar straights - had been trading "basis only" for some time prior to this weekend's news. This means traders could quote a two way price for the bonds but would not be bound to trade them. Any trades would be negotiated.     He said that recently there appeared to have been some speculative buying of the bonds from the U.S. But that European investors had been overall sellers.     Dealers noted that under the Chapter 11 filing noteholders will receive no interest payments.     Texaco also has eurobonds outstanding which are convertible into Texaco Inc common stock - known as convertibles. Trading did not open in these issues either. One convertible dealer said, "We're waiting to see the result of today's court hearing." Texaco is applying today in the Texas courts for relief from having to post the court bond.     Texaco shares were being indicated by over the counter share dealers here at around 26 to 28 dlrs compared with Friday's close in New York of 31-7/8 dlrs.     Pennzoil shares were indicated at 85 to 87 dlrs compared with Friday's New York finish of 92-1/4 dlrs.  REUTER ;

Oral proceedings were held in the Hague on Friday and the court said it would give its verdict within six weeks. "However, that is the normal wording and we expect the Hague court to refer questions on the interpretation and application of the levy to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg," Pex added.     Het Comite claims the way the levy is applied does not take account of currency cross-rates of exchange and can mean a compounder in one country being asked to pay a higher levy in its own national currency than it received down the chain from the original producer of the grain.     "We would like the Business Administration Court in the Hague to ask the Luxembourg Court of Justice not only whether the Dutch Grain Commodity Board, the levy collection agency, has interpreted the levy regulations correctly, but also whether the regulations themselves may contravene European law," Pex said.     "It is only with great regret that we have taken this route, but we have had no political help, and therefore have no option even though it could take years," Pex added.     Het Comite asked CHV to act as a test case against the grain levy because the bill the company received from the commodity board included grain from a wide variety of origins and was therefore considered to be the best general basis for a legal challenge to the levy, Pex noted.     Het Comite's actions will run in tandem with questions on the levy already posed to the Luxembourg Court in a case brought by the Association of European Animal Feed Manufacturers, FEFAC.  REUTER ;

Texaco, the third biggest U.S. Oil company, said it filed to protect itself from creditors while it fights a legal battle with Pennzoil Co <PZL> over the purchase of Getty Petroleum Corp <GTY> in 1984.     Many Japanese trading houses decided to stop dealing with Texaco several months ago as rumours it was about to file for bankruptcy spread through the market, the sources said.     "We haven't dealt with them for six months," said one Japanese trader.     Some Japanese trading houses with offices in the U.S. May ask for letters of credit if they decide to continue trading with Texaco, oil sources said.     They said Texaco, which said its bankrupcty protection measure will not affect the majority of its businesses, may find industry reaction stronger than anticipated.     "Texaco tried to buy substantial volumes of gasoline on the U.S. Gulf on Friday but no one offered to them," one trading house source said.     One U.S. Major is reviewing its relationship with Texaco, and an international oil trading company, while continuing limited transactions with Texaco, will send its lawyers to meet with the company tonight in New York, oil sources said.     But one Japanese oil company, which holds several joint venture oil exploration interests with Texaco, said business would continue as usual pending the outcome of the dispute, a company spokesman said.

TEST;13-APR-1987 07:07:37.34;EC COULD DECIDE ON JAPAN TRADE MOVES IN LATE MAY;     By Gerrard Raven, Reuters The European Community (EC) has effectively given Japan six weeks to take moves to open its market to imports before it decides on possible tough retaliatory trade measures, EC diplomats said.     They said EC foreign ministers will meet on May 25 and 26 to review the state of trade relations between the two sides.     The EC executive commission was asked by representatives of member states on Friday to propose a renunciation of some EC pledges to the world trade body, GATT, unless there are "adequate and early measures to open the Japanese market."     Such a renunciation would be the first step to imposing stiff increases in duties, or quantitative limits, on Japanese exports.     The diplomats said it was unlikely that the issue would be discussed in detail at the next meeting of EC foreign ministers on April 27 and 28 in Luxembourg as time was needed to prepare proposals for possible retaliatory action.     They said the commission has powers to take some limited action before getting ministerial approval to prevent Japanese exports of electrical, photographic and other goods being diverted to Europe in the wake of possible U.S. Tariff moves.     In May, the ministers are also likely to discuss how to prevent Japan from getting an extra trading advantage as a result of Spain and Portugal joining the bloc, which obliges them gradually to reduce tariffs on many industrial goods.     Meanwhile, Japan's trade surplus with the Community has grown steadily, registering a record 2.13 billion dlrs in March.  REUTER ;
TEST;13-APR-1987 07:10:46.69;TAKEOVER BATTLE FOR DOME PETROLEUM BEGINS;     By Solange De Santis, Reuters A takeover battle began today for debt-burdened Dome Petroleum Ltd <DMP.MO> as TransCanada PipeLines Ltd <TRP.TO> announced a 4.3 billion dlr offer and Dome said it is continuing talks with other possible buyers.     Companies mentioned in market speculation as potential buyers for Dome include Imperial Oil Ltd <IMO.A> which is 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp <XON.N>, <PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd> which is 87 pct owned by the conglomerate Canadian Pacific Ltd <CP.N> and British Petroleum Co Plc <BP.L>.     Along with the TransCanada offer, Dome has had another proposal from "a substantial company" and discussions with a third company which could lead to an offer, Dome said in a statement.     The statement confirmed Dome received TransCanada's bid, but did not identify the companies involved in talks.     TransCanada, Canada's largest natural gas pipeline operator, said it is offering Dome a package of cash, common and preferred shares, and shares in a new subsidiary which would own and operate Dome's assets. TransCanada said the offer is to Dome management, not to shareholders.     Dome has massive oil and gas landholdings in Canada, totalling 36.1 mln acres of which 7.4 mln have been developed. It also has tax credits worth about 2.5 billion dlrs.     Dome's statement said the TransCanada announcement "violated the terms and spirit of a confidentiality agreement entered into with prospective purchasers" and was apparently timed to prevent Dome from considering other proposals.     It said the TransCanada bid "seems to require favourable and substantial taxation concessions from the federal and provincial governments." But Dome added that its management and financial advisers will evaluate all proposals.     TransCanada chief financial officer H. Neil Nichols said he was surprised at the vehemence of Dome's statement and denied that TransCanada was trying to usurp other bids. "I find (Dome's statement) very bothersome. Once the board made the decision to authorise the proposal, it had a legal obligation to announce it," he said. Nichols said he did not know the identity of the other bidders, or the terms of other offers.     Dome common shares closed at 1.13 dlrs on Friday on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The preferred class A stock closed at 5.00 dlrs. Common stock traded as high as 25.00 dlrs in 1981.  REUTER ;

TEST;13-APR-1987 10:19:08.15;SAUDI ARABIA LIBERALISES BANKING SYSTEM;     By Stephen Jukes, Reuters Saudi Arabia has speeded up reform of its financial system with a package of measures designed to boost the economy and open up the Kingdom to the lucrative world of investment banking.     Bankers in Saudi Arabia detect a fundamental shift in policy stemming from a need to tackle the underlying contradiction between an Islamic legal framework and western banking system.     One senior banker in Jeddah said: "There is a new wind blowing... Saudi Arabia is moving on many fronts in a manner that is extraordinarily aggressive."     The speed of reform, begun last year but now gathering pace, has surprised bankers who have had to contend with a financial system that restricted internationalisation of the riyal and a religious court system that made debt collecting difficult.     Saudi banks, once the most profitable in the world, have generally reported falling profits for 1986 -- the fourth successive year of decline -- as loan loss provisions ate into already dwindling earnings.     Bankers say the Saudi Finance Ministry and Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) seem to have developed a new strategy although it remains to be seen how it will be implemented.     Reform started in 1986 with measures to boost previously dormant stock trading, but took off in earnest this year.     -- From January 1, SAMA liberalised the money market, giving banks greater access to liquidity aid via repurchase agreements.     -- From March 22, the Finance Ministry abolished withholding tax on funds borrowed by Saudi banks abroad.     -- From the same date, banks were notified of a new committee to be set up under the auspices of SAMA to hear bank disputes with creditors over non-payment of loans.     -- Also from the same date, banks were allowed to use mortgages as collateral for lending, banned since 1981.     -- Within a few weeks, the Kingdom's first stock market trading floor is expected to be opened.     Housed in central Riyadh in the building of the Saudi Industrial Development Fund, the floor will initially be used to trade shares on an auction system. Staff from each of the 11 commercial banks have been trained ahead of the launch and a new computer network has been set up.     One banker said: "The abolition of withholding tax will give banks the opportunity to participate in new instruments such as interest rate or currency swaps. At last SAMA and the Finance Ministry are opening up markets for investment banking."     Bankers say Saudi authorities appear to have been shocked into reform by pressure from banks and alarm at bank reluctance to extend further loans to the private sector.     Banks have lobbied hard for change, arguing that the religious, or Sharia, legal framework was inconsistent with the Kingdom's western banking system and made it nigh impossible for them to collect interest on bad loans through the courts.     As a result, many banks had virtually stopped new lending, but found themselves cut off from world investment banking by a series of restrictions. Withholding tax made it punitively expensive to take part in interest rate or currency swaps.     The private sector's frustration at the virtual standstill in bank lending overflowed at a businessmen's conference in the mountain resort in Abha last month and some powerful merchant families also called for change, bankers said.     "Banks lobbied hard and had the ultimate weapon to force change -- they stopped lending," another banker said. "That was stifling growth of the economy."     It is still unclear whether the new committee that will be set up to hear bank disputes with creditors will prove any more efficient than another non-Sharia system already in force, the Committees for the Settlement of Commercial Disputes (CSCDs).     Some bankers believe the new committee, yet to be formed, will simply delay pending cases and force banks into a series of private deals with creditors.     Nor is it clear what stance the new committee will take on interest payments, generally not recognised under Islamic law.     But other bankers say the move is clear recognition by SAMA and the Finance Ministry that Sharia courts and the CSCDs were not the correct bodies for hearing bank disputes.     Other reforms have been taken or are in the pipeline. Finance Minister Mohammed Ali Abal-Khail said in March that a new body would examine late government payments to contractors.     In addition, further moves are under way to align business life to the Gregorian calendar year, with companies being urged to adopt it as their financial year.     A black list of borrowers, started more than two years ago by banks, has recently been effectively sanctioned by SAMA, bankers say.     Banks are now not permitted to lend or engage in securities transactions with any party on the list.  REUTER ;

It will install a 175 mln dlr fine paper machine at Dryden and a 215 mln dlr newsprint machine at Thunder Bay to replace two aging machines. The Dryden machine will have capacity to produce 175,000 metric tons of fine papers annually when it starts up in the 1989 third quarter, while the Thunder Bay machine will have design capacity of 240,000 metric tons annually and is expected to be in operation by early 1991.     Great Lakes said it expects to pay for the program mainly with internally generated cash flow, but external financing will be available to support peak spending periods.     It said the expansion's effect on company employment levels will be minimal.     Great Lakes said a decision on a joint venture with five publisher-partners to construct a newsprint mill in northeastern Washington State should be coming from the partners in the near future.

A Texaco spokesman said the Dutch unit, wholly owned by Texaco Inc through holding companies, had its own financial relationship with banks, its own distribution facilities and refinery, and bought its own crude oil and products.     There had been no negative reaction from trading partners to the U.S. Move, although there was some negative influence on publicity, he said.     "The Dutch operations are not dependent on the U.S. For money or products. We are informing our customers that our business is not affected in any way," the spokesman said.     He said trading partners had not made demands for stricter credit terms than was normal in the international oil markets.     Spot market traders at Dutch arms of other major companies said they were acting as usual towards Texaco so far, but some were maintaining contact with their headquarters' credit control offices.

President Reagan's National Security Adviser Frank Carlucci told reporters "it looks like a very difficult situation at this point."     The Reagan administration is due to slap 100 pct tariffs on a range of Japanese products on Friday in retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to honor an agreement to stop dumping semiconductors in world markets outside the U.S. and failure to open its own market to U.S. goods.     White House chief of staff Howard Baker said that talks with the Japanese had failed to provide any reason to prevent the publication of a proclamation on Friday putting the new duties in effect.     "I assume that there will be a proclamation on Friday," Baker said. Carlucci said that the evidence of Japanese microchip dumping at below production costs in third countries had been fairly conclusive. He said that in U.S.-Japanese talks that concluded last Friday, Japanese officials presented statistics to show that Japan had made its market more open to American products.     "Our statistics do not confirm this, indeed they tend to go in the other direction," Carlucci said.

TEST;13-APR-1987 15:35:08.07;U.S. AGENCY RULES AGAINST BRAZIL ORANGE JUICE;  The U.S. International Trade Commission, ITC, voted to authorize the Commerce Department to impose anti-dumping duties on imports of Brazilian frozen concentrated orange juice.     The ITC voted 3-2 in favor of the anti-dumping petition in its final ruling on the matter.     Today's ITC ruling was consistent with the Commerce Department's final ruling of March 9, and activates an anti-dumping duty of 1.96 pct on imports of Brazilian frozen concentrated orange juice, Stephen Vastagh, ITC investigator said.     The ITC found that Brazilian orange juice imports have injured U.S. producers. The Commerce Department had already ruled that the imports were unfairly priced, and lowered to 1.96 pct the anti-dumping margin that in a preliminary decision last fall had been set at 8.5 pct, Vastagh said.     The U.S. government has been requiring bond to be posted on imports of Brazilian frozen concentrated orange juice since Commerce's preliminary ruling of last October 23, he said.     Commerce had ruled that one major Brazilian producer -- Cutrale -- would be excluded from the anti-dumping duty.     Brazilian imports account for about 40 pct of total U.S. supply, Vastagh said. Between December 1985 and November 1986, the United States imported the equivalent of 546 mln gallons of Brazilian orange juice worth 622 mln dlrs, he said.     Currently, the United States requires a 35-cent per gallon tariff on orange juice imports, Vastagh said.     An ITC spokesman said the agency would forward its final report on the anti-dumping case to Commerce by April 22.     Commerce then will process the anti-dumping order and transmit it to U.S Customs, which will liquidate bond entries dating from Commerce's preliminary ruling and begin assessing duties, Vastagh said.     He said about 12 Brazilian orange juice exporters, including three major shippers, would be affected by the decision.  Reuter ;

TEST;17-APR-1987 00:38:01.88;TAIWAN LIKELY TO BUY MORE U.S. SOYBEANS;  A 50 pct cut in the import tariff for soybeans should help boost 1987 U.S. Soybean exports to Taiwan, a spokesman for the joint committee of soybean importers told Reuters.     He said the cut to 3.5 from seven pct was approved by the cabinet yesterday and would go into effect within a week.     The cut will encourage local importers to increase 1987 soybean imports to 1.9 mln tonnes from 1.74 mln last year, he said. The previous target for 1987 was 1.81 tonnes.     Taiwan imports more than 90 pct of its soybeans from the U.S. And the rest from South America.     The spokesman said the increase in imports from the U.S. Is in line with government efforts to reduce Taiwan's trade surplus with Washington, which rose to 3.61 billion U.S. Dlrs in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78 billion a year ago.     "The tariff cut is very helpful for American suppliers (who want) to boost their exports to Taiwan," Steve Chen, country director of the American Soybean Association, told Reuters.  REUTER ;

TEST;23-APR-1987 19:02:27.01;FED DATA PROVIDE NEW EVIDENCE OF TIGHTER POLICY;     By Alan Wheatley, Reuters U.S. banking data released today are too distorted to draw sweeping conclusions about monetary policy, but they do support the market's assumption that the Federal Reserve has started to tighten its grip on credit, economists said.     "It's clear that the Fed has firmed somewhat. Discount window borrowings, net free reserves, the Fed funds rate average and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistent with a modest tightening," said Dana Johnson of First Chicago Corp.     Johnson, and several other economists, now estimate that the Fed funds rate should trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct.     Discount window borrowings in the week to Wednesday were 935 mln dlrs a day, producing a daily average for the two-week statement period of 689 mln dlrs, the highest since the week of December 31, 1986, and up from 393 mln dlrs previously.     Moreover, banks were forced to borrow a huge 5.2 billion dlrs from the Fed on Wednesday - the highest daily total this year - even though unexpectedly low Treasury balances at the Fed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more in reserves than the Fed had anticipated.     However, economists said it is almost certain that the Fed is aiming for much lower discount window borrowings than witnessed this week. They pointed to two factors that may have forced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week.     First, economists now expect M-1 money supply for the week ended April 29 to rise by a staggering 15 to 20 billion dlrs, partly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of the proceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions to pay annual income taxes.     As banks' checking-account liabilities rise, so do the reserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the Fed.     Required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 2.5 billion dlrs a day in the two weeks ended Wednesday, but economists said the Fed may not have believed in the magnitude of the projected M-1 surge until late in the week and so started to add reserves too late.     Second, an apparent shortage of Treasury bills apparently left Wall Street dealers with too little collateral with which to enagage in repurchase agreements with the Fed, economists said. Thus, although there were 10.3 billion dlrs of repos outstanding on Wednesday night, the Fed may have wanted to add even more reserves but was prevented from doing so.     "It's not at all inconceivable that the Fed didn't add as much as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral," said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc.     McCarthy estimated that the Fed is now targetting discount-window borrowings of about 400 mln dlrs a day, equivalent to a Fed funds rate of around 6-3/8 pct.     After citing the reasons why the Fed probably has not tightened credit to the degree suggested by the data, economists said the fact that the Fed delayed arranging  overnight injections of reserves until the last day of the statement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy.     Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank had not been convinced that the Fed was tightening policy. But after reviewing today's figures, he said, "It's fair to say that the Fed may be moving toward a slightly less accommodative reserve posture."     Leeds expects Fed funds to trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct and said the Fed is unlikely to raise the discount rate unless the dollar's fall gathers pace.     Johnson at First Chicago agreed, citing political opposition in Washington to a dollar-defense package at a time when Congress sees further dollar depreciation as the key to reducing the U.S. trade surplus with Japan.

Under the plan, 33 yards capable of building ships of more than 10,000 gross tons will curtail operations to three mln compensated gross registered tonnes (CGRT) a year against capacity of about six mln CGRT.     The Transport Ministry estimates new orders at 3.3 mln CGRT in the year to March 1988 and 3.1 mln the following year.     The industry has curtailed production due to oversupply nearly every year since 1977/78, under cartel or Transport Ministry guidelines. The latest guidelines call for a ceiling of four mln CGRT in the year to March 31.     The cartels, self-imposed and self-regulated, are not legally binding, but industry finds it in its own interest to stick to them.     The slowdown in orders has been caused by the strong yen and a protracted worldwide shipbuilding slump.  REUTER ;

She declined to reveal the bank's planned response but another bank official said it has not paid the penalty.     The bank said in a brief statement it believes that its use of the tax-free reserves is legal.     Financial institutions can set aside 0.003 pct of their risky loans as tax-free reserves. Fuji said a difference of understanding exists between the bank and the tax bureau regarding the use of tax-free reserves. It did not elaborate.

In 1986, farmers planted 61.5 mln acres of soybeans and 76.7 mln acres of corn, according to the February 9 USDA supply/demand report. The USDA is to release its 1987 planting intentions report March 31.     The survey included 15 soybean estimates and 13 corn estimates and was released in the March 16 Soybean Update newsletter sent to members.

Diplomats said EC environment ministers meeting here agreed member states would have to reduce by 20 pct over the next few years the emission of nitrogen oxide, widely seen as the main source of acid rain endangering forests and lakes.     The reduction would be compulsory for heavy vehicles, with tougher standards imposed for new models from April 1988 and for all new vehicles from October 1990.     The EC's executive Commission says the emission level of nitrogen oxide was expected to drop to 2.4 mln tonnes a year from three mln tonnes within the 12-nation Community if all heavy vehicles met the new standards.     There are an estimated nine mln trucks and buses in use in the EC, according to Commission figures.     The ministers also gave West Germany a go-ahead to move towards a ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol, after Bonn requested permission to do so to encourage the use of low-pollution cars, diplomats said.

Hussein warned his frontline troops to expect further Iranian attacks to spoil celebrations being organised throughout Iraq to mark what Baghdad has hailed as the failure of Iran's so-called year of decisiveness.     Iran's leadership had pledged a decisive breakthrough in the 6-1/2-year-long war in the Persian year -- which ended yesterday -- and mounted a major offensive towards Iraq's second city of Basra, on the southern front, in January.     Iraq has never given any casualty figures but Hussein conceded they were high.

TEST;23-MAR-1987 07:38:44.33;BRAZIL SEEKS TO REASSURE BANKS ON DEBT SUSPENSION;  Brazil wants to resume interest payments on its medium- and long-term foreign debt as soon as possible and is willing to discuss ways of softening the impact of the payments suspension on bank earnings, central bank governor Francisco Gros said.     Gros, speaking to reporters yesterday after his first meeting with Brazil's bank advisory committee since he was appointed last month, also promised a clear statement of Brazil's economic policy would be made in the next few days.     But bankers who attended the meeting with Gros said it was inconclusive.     The bankers also expressed disappointment Gros could not give assurances as to when interest payments on the 68 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term debt would restart.     "It was all very tentative. You can't expect to get very far at the first meeting," one banker said.     The meeting took place on the eve of the annual meeting here of the Inter-American Development Bank.     The most urgent item on yesterday's agenda was the need for a legal rollover of some 16 billion dlrs in trade and interbank credit lines extended to Brazilian banks which expire at the end of March.     Brazil has already frozen the lines to ensure it has enough credit to finance its day-to-day trade and commerce, but needs to request a formal extension of the commitments to head off possible lawsuits from disgruntled creditors.     The issue is whether the 14-bank steering committee will endorse Brazil's request to the 700 creditor banks worldwide or simply relay it without comment.     This delicate question was not resolved at yesterday's meeting, but lawyers from both sides will try to draft suitable language for a telex by midweek, Gros and the bankers said.     Gros said he will also formally ask the banks for a 90-day rollover of some 9.6 billion dlrs of debt which originally matured in 1986 and is now due to be repaid on April 15. Bankers said the request is a legal nicety since the money is subject to the moratorium.     Once interest on Brazil's debts becomes more than 90 days overdue, U.S. And Canadian banks must put the loans on non-performing basis and may book payments only as and when they are received instead of accruing the interest in advance.     Citicorp has estimated its profits for the first quarter would be cut by 50 mln dlrs if it put Brazil on a cash basis. Other U.S. Banks have also warned of earnings setbacks.     Gros said he wished the 90-day rule was more flexible and said he would be willing to sit down with the banks to see if there was a way round the problem.     He did not elaborate. But, asked whether a bridge loan might be arranged to pay the interest, he said, "It could happen."     Bankers said this possibility had not been raised at the committee meeting and dismissed it as inconsistent with Brazil's determination to find a long-term solution to the problem of servicing its 110 billion dlr foreign debt.     Gros himself said pushing the problem away for 90 days at a time is not very useful. Only if Brazil has access to new loans can it grow, export and pay its debts over the longer term.     "If the flow of funds dries up, a country like Brazil can't meet all its obligations," he said.     Gros defended Brazil's recent economic record, noting inflation slowed in February, the trade surplus rose and the public sector budget was in operational surplus.     But he said there was a need to spell out government policy, especially on prices.     "It's necessary to clarify policy for internal and external reasons," he said, but declined to say what economic measures might be introduced.     Once policy is in place, Gros said financing talks with the banks are likely to be tough and protracted, a sentiment echoed by the country's creditors.  REUTER ;

TEST;25-MAR-1987 13:07:57.86;CANADA SETS OIL INDUSTRY AID PACKAGE;  Canada's federal government will provide a 350 mln dlr oil industry aid package that includes cash incentives designed to cover one-third of a company's oil and gas exploration and development costs, Energy Minister Marcel Masse announced.     The aid program will inject about 350 mln dlrs a year into the oil and gas industry and could lead to more than one billion dlrs in new investment, Masse told a news conference.     The program will affect drilling done anywhere in Canada on or after April 1, 1987.     Masse told reporters that the government's oil industry aid package is aimed at small and medium sized companies.     The aid package, called the Canadian Exploration and Development Incentive Program, will restrict the total payments that any individual company can claim to 10 mln dlrs a year.     Masse said the program will probably generate new employment equivalent to 20,000 people working for a year.     He said oil industry aid is needed because exploration and development spending dropped by at least 50 pct since world oil prices fell during the first half of 1986.     Energy Minister Masse said the federal government decided to provide cash incentives so a large number of non-tax paying companies, mainly small Canadian firms, will receive the full value of the incentive. Such companies would not immediately benefit from tax benefits, he said.     The federal government also wanted to deliver an aid program outside the tax system. Finance Minister Michael Wilson is now reviewing Canada's tax system and plans to announce tax reform proposals later this spring.     An important feature of the aid program is a decision to let companies issue flow-through shares, allowing investors to benefit from the subsidy rather than restricting benefits to only participating companies, he said.     Allowing flow-through shares under the program will make it easier for companies to attract investors in exploration and development, Masse said.     He told reporters his department is still considering whether to allow partnerships and other entities to qualify for the subsidy.  Reuter ;

TEST; 1-APR-1987 13:20:07.33;CURRENCY INTERVENTION TIMING CRUCIAL - ANALYSTS;  The dollar's recent decline, despite massive central bank purchases, is a forceful reminder that official intervention in the foreign exchanges can work only if it is well-timed to coincide with shifts in market fundamentals or sentiment, dealers and analysts said.     Central banks may succeed in slowing a trend, but, without accompanying policy changes, they stand little chance of reversing the direction of an ever-growing global market in which more than 200 billion dlrs is traded every day, the sources said.     "Timing and psychology are the key to successful intervention," said Jim O'Neill, a financial markets economist with Marine Midland Banks Inc. The importance of complementary changes in economic fundamentals was underlined yesterday when a change in interest rates boosted the dollar, instantly achieving what the central banks had tried in vain to do for a week through open market intervention.     After Citibank raised its prime rate by a quarter-point to 7-3/4 pct, the first change in the rate since last August, the dollar started to advance and reached a high in Tokyo of 147.50 yen, up two yen from Tuesday's New York low.     By contrast, monetary authorities spearheaded by the Bank of Japan are estimated to have bought as much as 10 billion dlrs in the last 10 days of March but could not prevent the dollar from skidding through 150 yen and plumbing a 40-year low Monday of 144.70 yen. Some experts worry the central banks have lost more than just a temporary battle to prop up the dollar. The market is wary of being caught wrong-footed by a central bank foray, but is no longer mesmerized.     "They've lost their credibility. The market feels it can take on the central banks and win," said Michael Snow, head of treasury operations at Union Bank of Switzerland in New York.     The relative failure of recent intervention stands in sharp contrast to the success that central banks scored when they joined forces to drive the dollar down following the September 22, 1985, Plaza accord.     Then, however, central banks had an easy time of it, because the markets and the Treasuries of the major industrial powers were agreed that the dollar needed to head lower to redress massive worldwide trade imbalances.     Now, there is no such consensus. The market is saying that the dollar must fall further because the U.S. trade deficit is showing little sign of improvement, while Japan is resisting in a bid to protect its export industries.     For its part, the United States is apparently content to let the dollar fall gradually further and is paying little more than lip service to the February Paris agreement of the Group of Five plus Canada to foster stability, dealers say.     Specifically, they said the Fed's dollar-buying intervention has been half-hearted, designed more as a political gesture to Japan than to strike fear into the markets. "It's been pro-forma intervention," said Francoise Soares-Kemp, chief corporate trader at Credit Lyonnais.     Because of this discord and the market's momentum for a lower dollar, analysts said intervention looks doomed to fail.     "It's going to take a lot more than the central banks to hold the dollar (at these levels)," said Snow, who predicts another 10 to 15 pct depreciation.     "There have to be structural changes that occur to make the market stop selling dollars," added "Buying six billion dollars in three weeks is not going to do it."     Late last decade during the presidency of Jimmy Carter, when the dollar was last under heavy speculative attack, central banks sometimes intervened to the tune of six billion dlrs in a single day but still failed to stop the dollar falling to a record low of 1.70 marks, analysts said.     Snow said purchases on that scale now are unlikely. "I don't think anybody has the stomach for it, because they saw the futility of it in the seventies."     Indeed, because the market has grown in leaps and bound since then, intervention on an even greater scale would probably be needed to impress the market.     Trading volume in London, New York and Tokyo alone last year averaged nearly 188 billion dlrs a day, according to a joint central bank study, about double the previous estimate made just two years earlier by the Group of Thirty private research group.     There are signs that central banks, too, realize the futility of swimming against the tide.     Bank of Japan sources told Reuters in Tokyo earlier this week that they believed the limits of currency market intervention are perhaps being reached and that other methods for bolstering the dollar, such as invoking currency swap agreements with other central banks, are being considered.     "In this era of financial liberalization, it's almost impossible to control the flow of capital in and out of Japan," one senior official in Tokyo said.  Reuter ;

TEST; 3-APR-1987 05:48:33.73;JAPAN DENIES CHIP MARKET DOMINATION CHARGES;  A top Japanese official has insisted that the country was living up to its microchip pact with the US.     "It cannot be thought, nor should it be thought, we are trying to dominate semiconductors," Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) vice minister Makoto Kuroda said in a newspaper interview.     Kuroda, who will head a Japanese team going to Washington next week for emergency talks on semiconductors, told the Tokyo Shimbun that he would try his best to convince the United States of Japan's case.      Washington last week announced an imposition of tariffs on Japanese electronic products in retaliation for what it sees as Tokyo's failure to abide by the pact. Under the agreement Japan would stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and try to buy more American chips.     Kuroda told the newspaper that Tokyo has already taken measures to back up the pact, including production cutbacks.     While Japanese users are trying to increase chip imports, Tokyo cannot guarantee the United States a specified share of what in Japan is a free market, he said.  REUTER ;
TEST; 3-APR-1987 18:54:57.97;FINANCE UNITS GAIN FROM PARENT COMPANY, SAYS S/P;  Standard and Poor's said that currently 17 finance units benefit from parent relationships by receiving higher ratings than their financial performance alone would merit.     By drawing on its parent company's strength, a weaker finance subsidiary can achieve a credit rating as high as its parent.  An independent finance company on the other hand must operate within more stringent guidelines than a unit and is at a competitive disadvantage, S and P said.      The agency rates a finance unit on its creditworthiness  as well as the support agreement it has with its parent.     Standard and Poor's said that some finance subsidiaries have formal support agreements with the parent company which obligate the parent to maintain the unit's net worth.  The agreement assures that the unit meets its obligations on time and requires it to operate within specific guidelines.     Others have less formal agreements with the parent like General Electric Credit Corp <GE> whose AAA rating reflects its parent's, General Electric Co.  But GE injected sizeable equity into the unit at timely intervals, S and P noted.     These agreements are being tested as finance firms expand, and S and P said it will review a unit that violates the pact.  Reuter ;

TEST;26-FEB-1987 17:34:11.89;OPEC MAY HAVE TO MEET TO FIRM PRICES - ANALYSTS;     BY TED D'AFFLISIO, Reuters OPEC may be forced to meet before a scheduled June session to readdress its production cutting agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide in oil prices, oil industry analysts said.     "The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy as OPEC thought. They may need an emergency meeting to sort out the problems," said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, CERA.     Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets.     "OPEC's problem is not a price problem but a production issue and must be addressed in that way," said Paul Mlotok, oil analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc.     He said the market's earlier optimism about OPEC and its ability to keep production under control have given way to a pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices.     But some other analysts were uncertain that even an emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December.     "OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have deemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials," said the regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke on condition that he not be named. "The market is now trying to teach them that lesson again," he added.     David T. Mizrahi, editor of Mideast reports, expects OPEC to meet before June, although not immediately. However, he is not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems.     "They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the winter demand to sell their oil, but in late March and April when demand slackens," Mizrahi said.     But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd."     Analysts said that the next two months will be critical for OPEC's ability to hold together prices and output.     "OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks since buyers will come back into the market then," said Dillard Spriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York.     But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University's Energy and Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oil has been rising through the first quarter and this may have prompted excesses in its production.     "Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpd and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we are seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting this demand through current production," he told Reuters in a telephone interview.

The agreement, which covers about 9.5 mln dlrs in short term debt, had been scheduled to expire February 28.     Terms of the extension require Nuclear Data to obtain replacement financing from outside sources before June 30, it said.     If the company is unable to or fails to achieve certain projected operating results in the meantime, it will be required to divest enough assets to retire its debt, it said.     For the first nine months of its fiscal 1987 year ended November 30, 1986, Nuclear Data reported a loss of almost nine mln dlrs or 4.98 dlrs a share on revenues of 32.6 mln dlrs.     Nuclear Data cited improvement in printed circuit board sales and said it is confident it will obtain replacement financing.     In other action, Nuclear Data said it set up a 1.25 mln dlrs reserve to cover the revaluation of certain domestic medical inventory and the redirection of its U.S. medical sales efforts.     The reserve was taken to offset a decline in the U.S. dollar against the Danish Kroner and other factors adversely affecting sales of its Danish manufactured medical products in the U.S. market, Nuclear Data said.

Throughput at the refinery is currently estimated at 140-150,000 bpd, although total capacity is nearer 200,000 bpd.     Several other Mediterranean refineries are currently shutdown for maintenance, most of which were scheduled some months ago. But industry sources said that shutdowns may have been rearranged to avoid running negative-netback crude.      Tighter availabilities of products as a result of the  shutdowns in the Med is helping to keep products markets bullish, particularly for March deliveries, oil traders said.     Garrone's refinery at San Quirico (capacity 130,000 bpd) is due to shutdown on March 14th for three weeks, and the jointly-owned ISAB/Garrone refinery at Mellili, capacity 220,000 bpd, is due to start up around March 20-25th following its closure for maintenance a month ago, a company spokesman said.     The Esso Italiana refineries at Augusta and Siracusa will not be closing this spring, a spokesman for the company said.     In France, the distillation unit at Societe Francaise de BP's Lavera refinery has been closed for maintenance since March 2, and is due to restart early April. Total capacity is 181,900 bpd. It is currently operating at around 50 pct capacity, a company spokesman said.     Shell Francaise's Berre l'Etang refinery will shut down in early April until mid-June, a company spokesman said. Capacity is around 150,000 bpd. Compagnie Francaise de Raffinage (CFR) will close the visbreaker at its La Mede refinery in early April, but would not affect crude throughput at the refinery, a company spokesman said. Current capacity is 136,000 bbl/day.

TEST;16-MAR-1987 11:55:58.21;BANKS SEE GERMAN GROWTH OF AT LEAST TWO PCT;  External risks for the economy have increased, but growth of two to 2.5 pct this year is still possible, according to President of the West German Federation of Banks, Hanns Christian Schroeder-Hohenwarth.     Schroeder-Hohenwarth told a news conference the further fall of the dollar since the start of this year and the revaluation of the mark against European currencies meant West German exporters were facing a "rough wind."     However, domestic demand was continuing to rise and private consumption in particular would support the economy, he said. He saw good prospects for consumer industries.     Schroeder-Hohenwarth said economic policy now had to concentrate on strengthening this domestic growth. In this context, he welcomed a decision by the government to increase the scope of tax cuts due in 1988.     He added, a planned reform of the fiscal system scheduled for 1990, which was worked out by coalition partners this month, was an "important step in the right direction."     The government plans to cut corporation tax to 50 pct from 56 pct. However, Schroeder-Hohenwarth said the decision to cut the maximum rate of income tax to only 53 pct from 56 pct was "rather half-hearted."  REUTER ;

TEST;17-MAR-1987 13:58:02.67;HERRINGTON SAYS HE MAY CALL FOR OIL TAX BENEFITS;  Energy Secretary John Herrington said he may recommend to the White House that the domestic oil industry be given tax benefits to help it produce more oil and head off increasing U.S. dependence on foreign oil.     He said also at a news conference that he would recommend to the White House that the fill rate of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve be increased from its planned 35,000 barrels per day.     The oil reserve fill rate capacity is 100,000 barrels a day.     Herrington said he had always advocated a greater fill rate for the petroleum reserve, but the rate had been kept down because of budgetary constraints.     Herrington did not disclose what tax incentives he might advocate, but U.S. officials have shown interest in tax benefits for oil and gas exploration and for research and development into new ways to extract oil which is now considered uneconomical to produce.     He made the remarks in conjunction with the release of the Energy Department's study on oil's impact on national security.     Herrington said that before he disclosed what recommendations for tax benefits for the oil and gas industry he might make, he would raise the matter with the White House Economic Policy Committee to see if the proposals to increase oil production made good tax policy.     He said he would like to increase U.S. production by one mln barrels a day.     The report said that by the end of the century the United States may be relying on foreign sources for 50 pct of its oil consumption, posing a serious economic and national security threat.  Reuter ;

Reporting full-year data, it also said Gross Domestic Product rose 8.3 pct compared with 5.1 pct in 1985. An earlier estimate from nine-month data put full-year GNP and GDP growth both at 7.9 pct.     The government's GNP growth target for 1987 is five pct, the same level it had set for 1986.     The institute estimated per capita GNP for 1986 at 1,116.6 dlrs, up from 1,045.3 dlrs in 1985.     Officials blame the high 1986 GNP growth on a surge in domestic demand stemming partly from poorly controlled municipal expenditures in the early part of the year.

TEST;17-APR-1987 12:13:02.66;ARGENTINA SEES QUICK COMPLETION OF DEBT DEAL;     By Alan Wheatley, Reuters Argentina's controversial new financing package should be completed quickly thanks to a wide range of innovative options in the deal, said Jorge Gonzalez, undersecretary for external debt in the economics ministry.     The deal offers banks a lucrative fee if they sign early and an "exit bond" provision allowing banks to sell as much as five mln dlrs of their existing loans. Gonzalez also disclosed that banks will have the choice of lending up to one mln dlrs in the form of a bearer bond. "We expect to complete the package very quickly," he said in a telephone interview.     By providing their share of the 1.55 billion dlrs in new money being raised for Argentina via an easily tradable bearer bond instead of a participation in the syndicated loan, smaller banks could avoid time-consuming legal paperwork.     The bonds, currently dubbed "alternative participation instruments," would carry the same terms as the syndicated loan - a 12-year term, five years' grace and an interest rate margin of 7/8 pct over Eurodollar rates, Gonzalez said.     The idea of the "exit bond" is that a creditor bank may exchange up to five mln dlrs of existing debt for a new, tradeable bond that bears below-market interest rates.     In return for accepting a lower yield, the amount of debt converted will be subtracted from the bank's exposure for purposes of calculating its contribution to future new loans.     Gonzalez said it was difficult to say how many banks would take up the "exit bonds" because no such instrument has been offered before.     On paper, however, Argentina's lending syndicate could shrink dramatically because over 100 of the country's 350 creditors have exposure of less than five mln dlrs.     Details of the "exit bonds" are still being finalized, Gonzalez added.     Argentina has pressed hard for a streamlining of the lending process because it has bitter memories of its last package, which was agreed with the Citibank-led steering committee in December 1984 but not signed until August 1985.     Gonzalez praised the committee for its cooperation in the latest negotiations and said the resulting deal, which was announced by the banks on Wednesday, should put Argentina on the road to meeting its economic goals.     "We believe this is a package that will help Argentine to continue on the track it has elected to follow - stable growth and equilibrium in the external accounts," he said.     Asked what role the Reagan Administration had played in the final stages of the talks, Gonzalez said it had lent "practical support."     He did not elaborate, but bankers said the U.S. had pressed for an agreement after Economics Minister Juan Sourrouille threatened at last week's spring meeting in Washington of the International Monetary Fund to break off talks unless banks stopped blocking a deal.     The specter of Argentina emulating Brazil and suspending interest payments haunted policymakers and bankers alike, who have long feared the emergence of a debtors' cartel.     "That was a feeling among people on the committee," one banker said.     As a result bankers agreed to give Argentina the same interest rate margin as Mexico, 13/16 pct, on the rescheduling of 30 billion dlrs of debt, even though they knew this would raise the ire of the Philippines and Venezuela, which paid 7/8 pct on recent rescheduling packages.     Asked about the angry reaction of the Manila government, which promptly said Wednesday that it would demand a spread of 13/16 pct, Gonzalez said this was a matter between the Philippines and the banks.

"We're not very enthusiastic about Nigeria's debt rescheduling," said a senior official at a leading Japanese bank.     A team of Nigerian officials will meet with Japanese creditor banks here later this week to seek Japanese support for a proposed refinancing of part of Nigeria's 19 billion dlr foreign debt, bankers said.     The senior bank official said a majority of Japanese bank creditors are unwilling to provide any new credits to Nigeria although about 80 pct have reluctantly agreed to accept rescheduling of part of their existing loans.     "The problem is Nigeria has so far neglected us Japanese creditors and we have yet to receive a clear-cut picture of the nation's debt situation," said another Japanese bank official.     He said Japanese bankers were unaware of the exact extent of Western commercial bank exposure to Nigeria and were uncertain about the proposed refinancing package details.     Some 21 Japanese banks have loans outstanding to Nigeria, representing about four pct of the credit extended by Western commercial institutions, banking sources said.     They said Nigeria would probably request about 320 mln dlrs in fresh private bank money and rescheduling of some 1.4 to 1.5 billion dlrs in existing loans due in 1986 and 1987. Japanese banks want Nigeria to make clear its debt repayment scheme as well as its economic reconstruction plans during the two-day meeting here, the sources added.     "Otherwise, our response will be very negative," the senior official said.     Banking sources said some 80 pct of international creditor banks involved have responded positively to the Nigerian debt proposal.     Bank of Japan officials said they hope Japanese commercial banks will help Nigeria overcome its debt problems.     Barclays Bank plc <BCS.L> has the most exposure to Nigeria's debt and is chairing a bank steering committee looking at the problem, the banking sources said.

A company spokesman said the works council at Daimler's Unterturkheim plant, which makes axles and other components for Daimler cars, has withheld approval for overtime since the beginning of the month. The IG Metall metalworkers union in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg has called on works councils in the state to reject overtime in a bid to get industry to employ more workers.

TEST; 3-MAR-1987 13:25:05.20;TALKING POINT/AUTO SUPPLIER STOCKS;     By Richard Walker, Reuters The 1987 outlook for U.S. auto sales is clouded by a decidedly mixed sales forecast, and analysts who follow the industry say it is also true for companies that sell parts and equipment to the major car and truck manufacturers.     But while there are only four major U.S.-based automakers whose shares are traded on stock exchanges, there are thousands of big and small suppliers who sell a flood of original and replacement parts.     Analysts who follow the parts industry say there are many opportunities for investors brought on by the auto industry's intensified competition and the large volume of production in North America planned by Japanese automakers.     But assessing the supplier arena is far more complicated than for investors considering the stocks of the Detroit Big Three - General Motors Corp <GM>, Ford Motor Co <F> and Chrysler Corp <C>.     Despite widespread predictions that U.S. vehicle sales will decline about 10 pct from the record 1987 levels, Wall Street financial experts are still generally bullish on Ford and somewhat less so on Chrysler.     And analysts remain largely neutral to bearish on GM, the industry giant whose earnings have been dropping along with its sales as it struggles to reorganize and shed its unprofitable parts-making businesses.  more ;

TEST; 3-MAR-1987 15:57:37.08;OIL PRICES RISE ON SAUDI EFFORT;     BY TED D'AFFLISIO, REUTERS Crude oil prices rallied today, moving over 17.00 dlrs a barrel because of Saudi Arabia's determined effort to support prices, analysts said.     "The Saudis and other OPEC nations are jawboning the market, hoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this without another meeting," said Sanford Margoshes, oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.     "But OPEC is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due to seasonal declines in demand and some cheating," he added.     Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia has led the attempt to get other OPEC members to resist pressures to discount from the official prices agreed to last december.     The analysts said that to get others to hold the line, Saudi Arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council last weekend and at the Cooperation Council oil ministers' meeting the previous week.     The Saudis have also offered to support members having difficulty in selling their oil, analysts said.     "They are trying to make sure that no one discounts, and to prevent that, it appears that Saudi Arabia or some other OPEC member will allocate some of their oil sales to help members that lose sales," Margoshes said.     He added that the allocations would probably be in the form of loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales.     Analysts said this would be useful in keeping in line nations like Qatar, which has had trouble selling oil. But it is also likely that such assistance would be provided to Nigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts.     Analysts said that Saudi Arabia, with assistance from OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman, was trying to avoid an emergency OPEC meeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the December pact is falling apart.     Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Upham Harris and Co said, "both physical and futures markets have been oversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a short covering rally."     He believes an Iranian trade mission to Tokyo, which refused discounts to Japanese buyers, brought Japanese refiners into the market to cover their short positions.     Oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the market to but 10 cargoes of May Dubai, which sent prices up on Mideast sours, with Dubai trading up to 16.50 dlrs after trading yeterray as low as 15.63 dlrs and then spilled over into the North sea crude oil market.     Traders said that there have been persistent rumors today that Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brent for Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vessels being fixed to make such shipments.     North sea brent today rose over 17.00 dlrs with trades reported as high as 17.05 dlrs, up one dlr.     OPEC members' denials that they are producing over their quotas sparked moves to cover short postitions.     Indonesian oil minister Subroto said today that OPEC production was below the 15.8 mln bpd quota agreed to last december but he gave no details on OPEC production against claims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level.     "The production probably is about their quota level and largely because Saudi Arabia will not discount and canot sell its oil as a result," Margoshes said.     Analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of the current rally. Some believe prices can continue to rise if Saudi Arabia and OPEC hold steady in a refusal to discount.     But others said that despite the rally today there were still several fundamental factors, including demand, which could cut the rally short.     Marion Stewart, an indepedent petroleum economist, said slow growth in the economies of the U.S. and OECD would keep demand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to rise about 1.4 pct over 1986.

The delegate body, attending the American Pork Congress in Indianapolis, approved a pseudorabies control and eradication program at the state level after a recommendation from NPPC's PRV (pseudorabies virus) oversight committee.     The PRV committee received results of a three year, five state pilot project which had a 97.5 pct success rate in eradication of the disease within 116 hog herds. The project was jointly funded by the USDA and NPPC.     "Primarily it (the program) allows individual states to deal with their own problems according to a timetable that suits them best," Mike Wehler, member of the NPPC's PRV oversight committee said.     In regards to safe drug use, the delegates approved a plan asking that NPPC be active in establishing a national safe drug use program.     The program would establish better relationships between producers and veterinarians and eventually lead to a quality assurance program in pork production, according to the plan.     "This program basically communicates to the FDA that we are concerned about safe drug use and will do our part to use drugs safely, if FDA will allow the same policy to continue in effect," Wehler said.

TEST; 5-MAR-1987 15:55:20.24;VENEZUELA WILL REPROGRAM SIX BILLION DLRS IN DEBT;  Venezuela's recent agreement with its creditor banks reprograms six billion dlrs of its 21 billion dlr public sector foreign debt rescheduling and reduces repayments due between 1987 and 1992, Finance Minister Manuel Azpurua said.     Azpurua was commenting in a television interview on Friday's agreement to lower the interest margin to 7/8 pct over Libor from 1-1/8 pct and extend the period to 14 years from 12-1/2.     He said in addition to the reduction in amortizations over the next three years sought by the government, agreed at 1.35 billion dlrs instead of 3.335 billion, Venezuela will also pay less in the subsequent three years. The accord runs till 1999.     Azpurua said that in 1990, payments of restructured debt are lowered to 1.05 billion dlrs from 1.339 mln, to 1.25 billion from 1.994 mln in 1991 and to 1.45 billion from 2.403 billion in 1992.     He said the contingency clause implemented by Venezuela soon after the original rescheduling was signed in February 1986 stays in effect and that the new payment schedule is based on an assumption of oil prices varying between 15 and 18 dlrs a barrel.     Venezuela, hit by a 40 pct drop in oil income last year, had sought a direct link between repayments and the level of oil income, but banks resisted on the grounds this could create a dangerous precedent for other Latin American debtors.     Azpurua said the new terms have been telexed to Venezuela's 450 creditor banks for acceptance with information on government plans to draw up debt capitalization rules and return to the capital markets.     Public finances director Jorge Marcano said the government plans to issue dollar, mark and yen denominated bonds this year for amounts varying between 100 and 150 mln dlrs.     He noted that some existing Republic of Venezuela bond issues are maturing, and that the government intends to replace them with new issues to maintain its presence in the capital markets and encourage new investments through an enhanced credit image.

The director, Doresy Gardner, resigned in a March 10 letter to the Purolator board, which was included in a filing made by the company to the Securities and Exchange Commission.     Gardner noted that the terms of the merger agreement in which the company would bought out by a group of its managers and E.F.

"I, as a shareholder, wish to solicit, initiate or encourage such an offer or indication of interest, and believe, therefore, that I should resign as a director of the corporation," Gardner said in the letter.     "Accordingly, I hereby resign as a director of Purolator Courier Corp, effective immediately," he said.     Gardner said he believes shareholders could get a better deal than the buyout offer if the company would agree to be sold to some other entity, or if it could sell off all or part of its U.S. courier division.     On March 4, another Purolator shareholder, Rodney Shields, filed a class action suit on behalf of the company's shareholders charging the company and its board with breaching their fiduciary duty by failing to take steps to ensure that shareholders got the highest possible price in the buyout.

TEST;13-MAR-1987 10:21:58.01;WEST GERMAN RAILWAY ISSUES DOMESTIC STOCK;  The West German federal railway is raising 900 mln marks through a 10-year loan stock on the domestic market with a coupon of 6-1/4 pct and price of par, a Bundesbank spokesman said in response to enquiries.     Some 750 mln marks will be offered for immediate sale with 75 mln held back for market regulation and the remaining 75 mln placed with the railways own bank.     The stock will be offered for sale between March 17 and 19 and will be listed on all German stock exchanges from March 20 to 24. The stock pays annual interest on April 1.     Terms of the bond conformed with those expected earlier today, dealers said.     The bond rose in the first hour of grey market trading to less 7/8, less 5/8, after being quoted at less 1-1/8, less 7/8 in first business.     Dealers said demand rose owing to the bond's relatively small size.     In contrast, the last railway issue in January totalled 1.1 billion marks, of which 900 mln was distributed for immediate sale.  REUTER ;
TEST;13-MAR-1987 12:57:10.14;MIDLAND UNIT PULLS OUT OF EQUITY MARKET MAKING;  Midland Bank Plc <MDBL.L> said its Greenwell Montagu Securities unit would pull out of equity market making and concentrate instead on providing a broker dealer and agency service for its clients.     The operation has become the first major casualty in the London markets since deregulation last October abolished fixed commissions and allowed the merging of broking and jobbing operations into market making activities.     A spokesman said Greenwell Montagu Gilt Edged, which is a primary gilt edged market maker, and Greenwell Montagu stockbrokers, were not affected by the decision.     The market making operation had encountered much greater competition than had been expected in the post-Big Bang period, the spokesman added.     Although Midland considered that the operation would be viable in the long term, it would require the concentration of greater resources than could be justified for an operation that was not a core Midland activity. He confirmed Greenwell Montagu Securities had been losing money in past months.     The pull out from market making would be conducted in an orderly fashion in the near future. There might also be some job losses, he said without giving any details.     Market sources said it was no great surprise that a market maker had pulled out, as the intensity of competition had suggested for some time that sooner or later someone would decide to withdraw.     They said some retreat by Greenwell had been likely because of its losses, and added there also been speculation that it could pull out of market making in gilts also.     The move was unlikely to have any major impact on market confidence, as the occasional speculation in the past few weeks had had little impact.     Analysts said commission rates on institutional equity trades have dropped sharply in the five months since deregulation, with some firms covering some of their reduced profits by trading on their own account.     In a recent report, Greenwell Montagu Research said, "Those who have made profits are either immensely clever or immensely lucky. Some are already approaching the pain barrier, others are prepared to tough it out. But until some players withdraw from the market, it will be difficult to improve profitability."     Dealers said the pace of withdrawals was likely to speed up in the next year, and would intensify if the three-month bull run on the London stock exchange petered out.  REUTER ;

The rule, in effect since the mid 1970's, says in part, "During NYSE trading hours a member, a member organization or affiliated person may trade as principal or agent in any listed stock on any organized exchange of which they are a member, in any foreign country at any time."

TEST;16-MAR-1987 08:13:35.06;LEADING INDUSTRIAL NATIONS TO MEET IN APRIL;     By Peter Torday Leading industrial nations will meet again next month to review their accord on currency stability, but U.S. Officials said financial markets are convinced for now the countries will live up to commitments to speed up economic growth.     The narrow currency movements of recent weeks strongly suggests the six leading industrial countries have tamed the normally unruly financial markets and next month's talks seem likely to build on that stability.     A Reagan administration official said the Paris agreement last month was the main reason markets were calm.     But he said in an interview that financial markets also understood, "That all six countries concluded that the measures to be taken over a period of time in the future should foster stability of exchange rates around current levels. That is in fact what has happened since Paris."     Monetary analysts said stability has been helped in part by the decision of industrial nations to bury the hatchet and cease to quarrel over short-term policy objectives.     Instead they have focused on medium-term policy goals, but left room to adjust their agreements with periodic meetings.     The official refused to comment, however, on whether the agreement included a secret pact to consider further coordinated interest rate cuts -- a measure industrial nations have taken jointly several times in the past year.     On February 22, the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada agreed that major currencies were within ranges broadly reflecting underlying economic conditions, given commitments by Washington to cut its budget deficit and by Toyko and Bonn to boost economic growth.     The shake-up would strengthen the U.S. Position in future international talks.     "I think these changes will strengthen the President's hand politically and the stronger he is politically the better off we are with the Congress and the better off we are in international fora," said the official, an Administration economic policymaker. "So it would be beneficial to the continued conduct of our initiatives."     But the official also said the Administration would resist calls for a tax increase to cut the budget deficit -- a target Europeans say is crucial to help curb economic instability.     Currency analysts believe the Paris agreement set secret  short-term target ranges for their currencies with a specific agreement to defend those bands with intervention.     According to market sources, the ranges agreed were 1.60 to 1.90 marks to the dollar, and 140 to 155 yen to the dollar.     There is no official confirmation that specific bands  were set, although the agreement used the term "ranges", for the first time in an international economic agreement.     The Paris accord stated the six would cooperate closely to foster currency stability around current levels.     Last week, dealers said the Federal Reserve intervened to stop the dollar rising against the mark, which had breached 1.86 to the dollar. British authorities are also understood to have intervened to curb sterling's strength.     International monetary sources say finance ministers and central bankers, who will review market performance and their own economic prospects, will reassemble again in Washington just before the April 9 policymaking meeting of the International Monetary Fund.     The sources said Italy, which refused to join the Paris pact, was invited back by Treasury Secretary James Baker.     Since Paris, there are signs West German growth is slowing, while U.S. Officials said they were giving Japan until April to show that an economic stimulus package was in the offing.     Signs of concern about German prospects emerged recently when Bundesbank (central bank) president Karl Otto Poehl told bankers he would consider cutting West German interest rates if the Fed was ready to follow suit.     A Reagan Administration official said this would show there had been some change in approach on the part of the central bank in Germany.     But he declined to comment on the prospects for action by the Fed and the Bundesbank.     "If there is such a provision it is private and if I talked about it, it would no longer be private," said the official, who asked not to be identified.     Public comments by Fed officials suggest the central bank is keeping credit conditions broadly unchanged, but if the major economies continue to show sluggish growth and the U.S. Trade deficit remains stubbornly high, further coordinated action could be on the April agenda.

The union said the Kansas City judge acted on its complaints made seeking to enforce a recent U.S. Court of Appreals decision reinstating contractural provisions which existed at the time of the 70-day strike which ended in May 1986.     The flight attendants union said it petitioned the district court because of TWA's ongoing refusal to allow union representatives on the airline's property.     The union said the court order also requires TWA to post notices of a temporary restraining order throughout its system and to districute copies of the order to all its flight-attendant employees.     The union said the order requires the airline to appear in U.S. District Court in Kansas City March 20 to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not be granted.  Reuter ;

TEST;17-MAR-1987 12:40:41.02;ANALYSTS SEE EARLY ONE POINT CUT IN U.K. BASE RATE;  British bank base lending rates are likely to fall by as much as one full point to 9-1/2 pct this week following the sharp three billion stg cut in the U.K. Central government borrowing target to four billion stg set in today's 1987 budget, bank analysts said.     The analysts described Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's budget as cautious, a quality which currency and money markets had already started to reward.     Sterling surged on foreign exchange markets and money market interest rates moved sharply lower as news of the budget measures came through, the analysts said.     Lloyds merchant bank chief economist Roger Bootle said he expected base rates to be cut by one full point tomorrow.     "This is very much a safety-first budget in order to get interest rates down," he said.     Bootle said the money markets had almost entirely discounted such a one point cut, with the key three month interbank rate down to 9-11/16 pct from 9-13/16 last night, and it would be rather conservative for banks to go for a half-point cut now.     Midland Bank treasury economist David Simmonds said he, too, expected base rates would be a full point lower by Friday, but this would likely happen via two half-point cuts.     "This budget is designed to please both the markets and the electorate. The implications for interest rates are very favourable, we could have a half-point cut tomrorow and another such cut before the end of the week," Simmonds said.     Pointing to buoyant U.K. Retail data released yesterday, he said Lawson had done well to resist pressures for a sharp cut in income tax rates at the expense of a lower borrowing target. "There is no real need to boost private consumption," he said.     National Westminster Bank chief economist David Kern said the lower borrowing target set in the budget had increased the likelihood of an early one-point base rate cut.     Kern said the budget would have to be analysed carefully, in particular to see how exactly Lawson planned to achieve the sharper than expected borrowing target cut, before a one-point base rate cut could be implemented.  But providing the budget small-print was convincing, "and I suspect it will be, it is entirely possible that we see one point off base rates by the end of this week," Kern said.     Bootle of Lloyds said the expected base rate cut would pave the way for an early one-point cut in mortgage lending rates. This would help achieve Lawson's lower than expected consumer price inflation target of four pct at end-1987, he said.     U.K. Base rates were cut last week to 10-1/2 pct from 11 pct after sustained pressure from the foreign exchange, money and government bonds (gilts) markets.     But building societies said they would not cut lending rates until base rates had fallen by one full point.  REUTER ;
TEST;17-MAR-1987 13:39:22.58;U.K. BUDGET SEEN BOOSTING GOVERNMENT BOND MARKET;     By Norma Cohen, Reuters Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's budget contained virtually everything the government bond (gilts) market had hoped for and is likely to help prices race ahead in coming months, analysts and traders said.     Indeed, in the first half hour after Lawson completed his speech, gilt prices soared about 1-1/2 points, an extremely sharp gain in such a short period of time. Overall, they rose about two points on the day.     "This budget was incredibly bullish for the gilts market," Morgan Grenfell and Co Ltd economist Stephen Bell said.     Analysts said that in the light of the reaction to the budget in the gilts and U.K. Money markets, U.K. Commercial bank base rates are likely to be cut by as much as a full point tomorrow.     Analysts said the market's euphoria was simply a reflection of supply and demand. The crucial piece of news in the budget was that the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement would be held to 4.0 billion stg.     By comparison, a year ago, the PSBR was set at 7.0 billion stg.     The lower PSBR means the Bank of England will have to offer far less new stock to the market to meet its funding needs and the scarcity factor is sure to drive prices up further, analysts said.     "The PSBR at four billion is lower than anyone realistically expected," Bell said. Most market expectations called for the Chancellor to announce a PSBR of about 5.5 billion stg.     S.G. Warburg Securities Co Ltd economist John Shepherd said that overall, the Bank will have to sell about two billion less in new securities next fiscal year -- a cut of about 15 pct in total new issue volume.     Chase Manhattan Securities Ltd international economist Andy Wrobleski noted the Bank has already raised about 1.8 billion stg of next year's funding needs this year via a series of tap issues.     The issues have been in a partly-paid form where the full price does not have to be paid until the start of the new fiscal year and therefore they are not counted in the current year's fund raising.     But the Bank of England will also be constrained from issuing gilts in the conventional form by its promise to try out a U.S.-style auction system in which firms bid for new stock.     The Bank will also have to offer at least one index-linked issue where the rate paid to investors is tied to the Retail Price Index, leaving about one to two billion stg, in total, to be raised in the form of traditional stock.     Analysts noted that the budget contains provision for a two pence in the pound cut in the basic rate of income tax, in line with most market expectations, although some operators had expected a cut of up to four pence in the pound.     The gilts market approved of the more modest tax cut, Shepherd said, because "If it was more than two pct, they would have become concerned about the economy heating up again."     Also, a cut of two pence in the pound suggests that if the ruling Conservative party is re-elected, another two pence cut can be offered at budget time next year.     Analysts said the gilts market may also be building steam on the political implications of the budget which suggests an early election.     "All the goodies in this budget will be in place by the middle of May," Morgan Grenfell's Bell said. "This makes a June election very likely."     Bell said some politically popular provisions omitted from the budget, such as lifting the ceiling on the amount of mortgage eligible for tax benefit and some provisions on pensions, could not have been implemented until autumn anyway.     At that rate, they would have been of little use for a political party expecting to call an election in June.     Also, analysts noted, the budget does not go overboard with measures that are seen as generous to the wealthy.     "This will be a difficult budget for the (opposition) Labour party to attack," Shepherd said.  REUTER ;

"We have yet to finalize details on how the compensation will be carried out and how OPEC production quotas will be affected," he said during the signing of a joint venture deal with Union Pacific Corp today.     He said an agreement was initialled on a visit last week by Ecuador's deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite.     He pointed out that there are some contractual points to be considered. Venezuela, possibly unique among oil exporters, requires its clients to sign final destination clauses to ensure its oil is not resold on the spot market.

Ecuador would pay back the oil at a rate of 35,000 bpd.

TEST;18-MAR-1987 12:14:17.19;GERMAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE LOWERS GROWTH FORECAST;  The DIW economic research institute said West German economic growth in 1987 is unlikely to reach the 1.5 pct rate it had forecast earlier this year.     The institute, whose forecasts are more pessimistic than those of the other four leading German institutes, said the economy had passed its peak in the summer of 1986, and its prospects had dimmed significantly since the autumn.     The DIW repeated earlier predictions that gross national product (GNP) in the first quarter of 1987 would contract in real, seasonally adjusted terms against the weak final quarter of last year.      The DIW said that even if the economy recovers in the remaining three quarters, it was unlikely that demand and production would rise strongly enough to bring GNP growth up to 1.5 pct.     Other institutes and economists have recently revised their forecasts for German 1987 growth to around two pct.     In a report DIW disputed arguments by other economists that the economy was showing mixed development, with domestic demand healthy but foreign demand weak.     DIW said the crucial split was between weak demand for capital goods, and strong demand for buildings and consumer goods, not between foreign and domestic demand.     It noted that domestic demand for capital goods had been hit in recent months by the weakness of exports, which had caused West German firms to scale back investment plans.     Service industries, unlike manufacturing industry, were continuing to do well because they relied on consumer demand, it said.     In a separate report the HWWA economic research institute in Hamburg said West Germany's real trade surplus would fall markedly this year.     However, the nominal trade surplus would show little change from 1986's record 112.2 billion marks because of a further improvement in the terms of trade on average in 1987 compared with 1986, it said.

TEST;18-MAR-1987 15:30:34.49;MEXICAN HYDROCARBON RESERVES FALL SLIGHTLY IN 1986;  mexico's proven reserves of liquid hydrocarbons at end-1986 were 70 billion barrels, slightly down from 70.9 billion a year ago and 71.75 billion in 1984, the state oil company petroleos mexicanos (pemex) announced.     Reserves were just 5.77 billion barrels in 1974, rose sharply to 40.19 billion in 1978 and flattened out at 72 billion in both 1981 and 1982.     In its annual report, pemex said average crude output in 1986 was 2.43 mln barrels per day, 202,000 bpd down on 1985. Average exports were 1.29 mln bpd, down from 1.44 mln bpd.     The company did not say what percentage of hydrocarbons was crude oil, but has previouly said it was about 48 pct.     Natural gas output in 1986 was 3.43 billion cubic feet per day, down from 3.6 billion in 1985.     Due mainly to the fall in oil prices to around 12 dlrs from 25 dlrs in the year, 58 wells, both exploratory and production, were suspended, 38 of them in less productive areas than the offshore campeche fields which accounted for 64 pct of production.

Production by the company, Taiwan's largest steel maker, is expected to rise to 3.33 mln tonnes from 3.27 mln, a spokesman told Reuters.     He attributed the export decline to the rise in the Taiwan dollar, which has eroded the competitiveness of the company's products against those from South Korea.     The spokesman said the company is undergoing an expansion project which calls for a boost in production to 5.65 mln tonnes a year from the current level. The project, costing 52.3 billion Taiwan dlrs, will be completed by April 1988, two months ahead of the targetted date, he said.

TEST;22-MAR-1987 22:16:55.97;PREMIER SAYS YUGOSLAVIA WILL PAY ITS DEBTS;     By Peter Humphrey, Reuters Yugoslavia, whose economic crisis is under close scrutiny by foreign creditors, will not follow Brazil by suspending repayments on its large foreign debt, Prime Minister Branko Mikulic was quoted as saying.     Mikulic was speaking to West German journalists in an interview published yesterday by the Tanjug news agency.     He said Yugoslavia had always paid its debts and would continue to do so, but he said creditors and international institutions should show more "understanding" for Yugoslavia's situation.     Mikulic said Yugoslavia had "understanding" for what Brazil had done.     Yugoslavia has almost 100 pct annual inflation, lagging exports and low productivity. This month Makulic imposed partial freezes on wages and prices which led to widespread strikes. Tanjug said in the interview Mikulic warned the army could be called in if Yugoslavia's political system was threatened. Official reports show Yugoslavia ended 1986 with hard currency debt of 19.7 billion dlrs. In 1986 it repaid a record 5.97 billion in capital and interest, reducing its overall debt by 996 mln dlrs.     Government ministers told reporters last week they regretted Yugoslavia made such an effort in 1986. They said the cost to the economy had been too great.     Earlier this month deputy prime minister Janos Milosavljevic said Yugoslavia needed new credits. Foreign Minister Raif Dizdarevic said in Caracas, "radical changes" in interest rates and repayment times were needed.     Western economists said Mikulic's remarks, taken with those of his ministers, could be a signal some problems were seen ahead in financing the debt repayments.     Yugoslavia's debt refinancing timetable is to be considered by the Paris club at the end of this month.     The International Monetary Fund, which recently reviewed the Yugoslav economy, is said by Western diplomats to be alarmed at what it sees as a deteriorating economic crisis here and the possibility of balance of payments problems later this year.     Mikulic visits West Germany next week, and debt is expected to figure high on the agenda of his talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl.  REUTER ;

In its annual report and in a briefing for reporters, the Bank made it clear, however, that the Latin countries needed vast amounts of new investment if they are to strengthen their ailing economies in the period ahead.     The report said that Latin America continued to emerge slowly from the deep recession that began in the early 1980s, with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) edging up to nearly four pct from 3.5 pct in 1985.     The report said the region's improved economic growth last year was based on a rise in internal demand and fuller utilization of previously underused production capacity.     "This situation will be difficult to duplicate in 1987 and beyond because no significant new investments are being made," the report said.     The Bank's lending last year consisted of 63 loans totaling 3.04 billion dlrs, bringing the agency's cumulative lending to 35.44 billion dlrs.     Of last year's loans, 2.26 billion dlrs was actually disbursed, bringing total disbursements to 24.03 billion dlrs.  Reuter ;

American Express said it had agreed with Nippon life that American Express will hold a minimum of 40 pct of Shearson until January, 1999.    American Express said 7.5 mln Shearson shares would be held by certain employees of Shearson and one mln by a Shearson stock ownership plan to be formed.     American Express said it anticipates a registration statement for the public offering will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission shortly.     American Express also declared a two-for-one stock split and raised its quarterly dividend to 38 cts per share from 36 cts on a pre-split basis. Both dividends are payable May 8, to shareholders of record April 3. There are currently 215 mln American Express shares outstanding.     The transaction with Nippon Life remains subject to approval by the Japanese ministry of finance, which is expected in April.     American Express also said an agreement was reached by Shearson and Nippon Life providing for a joint venture in London.     The venture will focus on investment advisory asset management, market research and consulting on financing. It also said it expects the relationship to extend to selected projects involving American Express, Shearson Lehman and Nippon Life in key financial centers of Asia and other regions, and to future personnel exchanges.     Under the agreement, Nippon will receive 13 mln cumulative preferred shares with a five pct dividend rate. The cumulative preferred stock will become convertible with voting powers to an equal number of common shares following the U.S. government approvals.     American Express said that assuming conversion of the preferred stock held by Nippon, 100 mln shares of Shearson Lehman common stock would be outstanding.

Asked whether a dollar/yen rate of 148 or 149 reflected economic fundamentals, he said current rates almost reflect fundamentals.     Sumita told reporters major nations have cooperated to bring about currency stability in line with the Paris agreement, which stipulated that they would closely cooperate to that end. He repeated the central bank will intervene if necessary, adding he did not think a dollar free-fall was likely.     But Sumita said he could not say exactly what currency levels would be considered in line with underlying economic fundamentals.     In Paris on February 22, Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate to hold currencies around their then current levels.     Sumita said he could not find any specific reasons behind the fall of the dollar to a record low against the yen yesterday. But he said the market rushed to sell dollars as it nervously reacted to statements abroad and to developments surrounding trade tensions.     U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said over the weekend that the Paris pact did not encompass fixed tragets for the dollar. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter called U.S/Japan relations on certain key trade issues very strained.     The market reacted nervously because the dollar has been moving narrowly against the yen since mid-January, Sumita said. He added he does not expect the yen/dollar exchange rate to remain unstable because the market is concerned about a sharp rise of the yen.     The Bank of Japan will keep a close watch on exchange rates in line with the Paris accord, he added.  REUTER ;

Bumpei Otsuki, president of the influential Japan Federation of Employers' Associations, (Nikkeiren), told reporters: "The yen might rise as far as 140 (to the dollar). The U.S. Economy is not good, and as long as the U.S. Economy is not good, the U.S. Will put various pressures (on Japan)."     "The yen's level depends on the condition of the U.S. Economy rather than Japan's economy, and as long as the American situation is bad, the yen will continue to rise," he said.     To cope with the negative impact of the strong yen, Japanese enterprises must strive to cut costs by all means, including holding down wages as much as possible, Otsuki said.     He rejected recent calls from some government quarters for wage increases this year as a means of raising private consumption and thus boosting domestic demand.     "We have to keep wages as low as possible," he said.     He also said the yen's large and rapid rise is depressing the outlook for the Japanese economy, noting that in addition to hurting exporters it is also damaging domestic market manufacturers through cheap imports.     Parts of the service sector are also threatened, Otsuki said.     Tertiary industries provide services to manufacturers and a downturn in manufacturing profits will adversely affect service industries, he said.     It is also doubtful whether the tertiary sector can fully employ those put out of work in the manufacturing sector, he said.     Profits of service sector companies are likely to fall in the business year ending in March 1988, leading to a possible recession in the Japanese economy, he said.     Otsuki said economic growth is unlikely to pick up beyond levels experienced in 1986.     The government's Economic Planning Agency said last week the economy grew at 2.5 pct in 1986, the worst performance since 1974 when the economy shrank 1.4 pct due to the first oil price crisis.     In order to stimulate domestic demand and boost the economy, tax reforms aimed at bringing down the cost of land and reforming the nation's housing stock are needed, along with steps to bring down the high cost of commodities, he said.

TEST;26-MAR-1987 16:23:06.43;BP <BP> MAY HAVE TO RAISE BID -  ANALYSTS;     By STEVEN RADWELL, Reuters British Petroleum Co PLC may have to raise its planned 70 dlrs a share tender offer for the publicly traded shares of Standard Oil Co <SRD>, analysts said.     "There's a lot of speculation here that someway or other they would be forced to come up with another bid," said Rosario Ilaqua of L.F. Rothschild.     And despite BP managing director David Simon's denial today that BP would raise the offer, the analysts said that remained a distinct possibility.     Analysts said they base their thinking on Royal Dutch/Shell Group's <RD> <SC> bid to buy the outstanding stake of Shell Oil Co in 1984 and 1985. Royal Dutch/Shell eventually raised its initial 55 dlrs a share offer to 60 dlrs a share, after lawsuits by minority shareholders.     "I think they're going to have to go a little higher eventually, just as Royal Dutch/Shell had to go a little higher for the Shell Oil minority shares," Bruce Lazier of Prescott Ball and Turben said. He estimated a price of 75 dlrs a share.     Royal Dutch/Shell offered 55 dlrs a share for the 30.5 pct of Shell Oil it did not already own in January of 1984. After objections from minority shareholders about the price, Royal Dutch/Shell raised its bid and began a 58 dlrs a share tender offer in April 1984.     But shareholders sued and a court blocked completion of the offer. After months of wrangling over the worth of Shell Oil, Royal Dutch/Shell agreed to another two dlrs increase.     It ended up paying 5.67 billion dlrs for the outstanding Shell Oil stake, a significant premium to its original bid of about 5.2 billion dlrs.     The analysts made their comments before Simon's remarks at a BP press conference in New York this afternoon.     Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc told clients this morning that a sweetened offer was possible. The analyst said the bid could be raised by two dlrs a share.     Analysts do not expect regulatory hurdles because of the Royal Dutch/Shell group precedent. But there may be shareholder lawsuits for the same reason, they said.     Goldman Sachs and Co, BP's investment advisor, advised the Shell Oil board in 1984 and 1985.  Reuter ;

Nakasone also instructed the government's Economic Planning Agency (EPA) to work closer with the LDP to work out a full-fledged economic plan to boost domestic demand as pledged at last month's Paris currency stability accord by six industrial countries, the officials told Reuters.     The date for the government to announce its package, based on the LDP's suggested measures, is not yet known but it may be before the fiscal 1987 budget passes the Parliament around late May, the officials said.     The government has said in the past the package should come after the passage of the budget.     But calls have grown at home and abroad for the government to announce it earlier as budget debates have been stalled by an opposition boycott of parliamentary business in protest at a planned five pct sales tax.     EPA chief Tetsuo Kondo told a press conference he sees a need to work on the economic plan early although the government's stance on the date for the plan remains the same, an EPA spokesman said.     Projected measures include promoting house construction, infrastructure and urban development, he quoted Kondo as saying.     Under last month's Paris currency agreement, Japan promised to work out a comprehensive economic plan to stimulate domestic demand, increase imports and so help reduce its huge trade surplus.     The government announced today Nakasone will visit Washington on April 29 for a week to discuss bilateral issues, including the trade imbalance, with President Reagan and other officials.  REUTER ;

TEST;27-MAR-1987 11:44:23.47F;U.S. TELLS INDIA IT CAN BUY SUPERCOMPUTER;  The United States told India it could purchase a supercomputer because U.S. concerns over a possible security breach had been removed.     U.S. officials said the United States did not specify which supercomputer it was willing to sell but had offered India a choice.     They declined to comment on a newspaper report that the United States wanted to sell India a computer less powerful than the Indians had sought.     They said the United States was awaiting a response from New Delhi.     The New York Times, quoting unnamed government and industry officials, said the United States wanted to sell a weaker-model supercomputer to India.     U.S. and Indian negotiatiors reached a tentative agreement in December on security precautions for the sale of the computer, which has a wide variety of military applications.     "We have told the Indians that we ratify the tentative agreement reached in December," a U.S. official said.     India proposed to use the supercomputer to analyze weather patterns to forecast monsoons.     The sale of a U.S. supercomputer to a non-Western nation is rare. This transaction was seen as a test of a technology-sharing agreement signed by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and President Reagan in 1985.     The American concern was that the advanced technology might fall into the hands of the Soviet Union, which is India's main weapons supplier.     One condition calls for U.S. personnel to service the computer in India for three years, a Pentagon spokesman said.     The spokesman predicted the negotiations, which also involved the State Department, could be quickly resolved.     The only countries which make the supercomputer are the United States and Japan.     In New Delhi, Indian officials told Reuters that a U.S. offer had been made.     "An announcement will be made in 10 days to two weeks time," an official said.  Reuter ;

TEST;28-MAR-1987 00:33:35.40;TAIWAN TO STUDY SUSPENDING FOREX CONTROLS;  Premier Yu Kuo-Hua ordered financial officials to quicken the pace of relaxing foreign exchange controls and study the possibility of suspending the controls, a cabinet statement said.     The statement quoted Yu as telling Finance Ministy and Central Bank officials the relaxation was needed to help reduce Taiwan's surging foreign exchange reserves, which reached a record 53 billion U.S. Dollars this month.     Finance Minister Robert Chien told reporters his ministry and the Central Bank would work jointly on new measures to ease the controls, but he did not give details.     Yu said the government could maintain the framework of the foreign exchange controls while finding ways to ease them. The controls would be used during emergency.     Taiwan's reserves have resulted largely from its trade surplus, which hit 15.6 billion dlrs in 1986 and 10.6 billion in 1985. About 95 pct of the surplus was from Taiwan's trade with the United States, according to official figures.     But he said that while easing the controls would help reduce the reserves, it would not do so substantially in a short time.     Economists and bankers said the new decision resulted from growing pressure from the United States, Taiwan's largest trading partner, which buys almost half the island's exports.     Lu Ming-Jen, economic professor at Soochow University, told Reuters: "The decision came a little bit late. But it was better than never."     Ko Fei-Lo, Vice President at First Commercial Bank, said the government should rapidly relax its foreign exchange controls and open its market wider to help balance trade with its trading partners, especially the United States.     "The liberalisation in both imports and foreign exchange controls will not only help our trading partners, but also help our own economic problems," he said.     He said the mounting foreign exchange reserveshelped boost Taiwan's money supply by 48.22 pct in the year to end-February.  REUTER ;

Abdoulaye Fadiga told reporters after a regular one-day meeting of UMOA finance ministers here that the bank's participation in future credit talks with the IMF would promote a greater coherence in Fund aid granted to the region.     But he stresed that UMOA, which last month called for a new relationship with the IMF, was not contemplating a break with the fund.     "Member states (of UMOA) never envisaged breaking with the Fund," he said.     He said an extraordinary UMOA meeting held in Ivory Coast's inland capital, Yamoussoukro, last month, stresssed the need for growth-oriented IMF adjustment policies.     "Borrowing to pay off debts cannot be a solution," Fadiga added.     UMOA members are Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo. The zone's common-curreny, the CFA franc, is pegged to the French franc at the rate of 50 CFA francs to one French franc.     Fadiga said many of the region's problems stem from low commodity prices and a weak dollar.     He applauded last week's agreement between producers and consumers on the functioning of a new international cocoa pact, saying negotiation of other commodity accords would benefit UMOA countries.

Willy de Clercq, External Relations Commissioner of the European Communities, told a news conference that China's application would involve long and difficult negotiations.     China formally applied to join GATT in July 1986 and in February presented a memorandum backing its application, which De Clercq said was now being studied. Questions would then be presented to China.     "After China, other important state-trading countries including the Soviet Union, will probably demand accession. China's application could be considered a test case," he said.     He said the EC strongly backed China's application, but others among GATT's 92 contracting parties took a tougher line.     Among the numerous problems of a huge centrally-run economy entering a free trade system are tariffs and reciprocity and the expectation that China will practice an open-trade policy without trade discrimination, de Clercq added.     De Clercq noted the different dimensions of the Chinese economy and those of Hungary and Yugoslavia, the two current Socialist GATT members.     On China's import potential, he said a foreign exchange shortage would force China to import less this year and next than in the past, with an emphasis on technological equipment and capital.

TEST;31-MAR-1987 12:37:45.33;U.S. TAX AGENCY INCREASES INTERNATIONAL AUDITS;  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) said it was stepping up compliance efforts by its international staff to recover some of the billions of dollars lost each year in unpaid taxes.     The agency was shifting emphasis by its international branch to increase compliance by the 47,000 foreign-owned American companies and foreign firms operating in the United States, IRS officials said at a news conference.     The IRS also was taking a closer look at compliance by Americans living abroad and by taxpayers in the United States with income from overseas investments.     Percy Woodard, assistant IRS commissioner, international, denied that the agency was picking on foreign companies, but he said fewer of them pay taxes than comparable U.S. firms.     In some industries, one pct of foreign firms paid U.S. taxes, he said. Other IRS staff said the taxes paid by foreign companies ranged from 16 to 19 pct less than taxes paid by U.S. firms.     "If our taxpayers in another country are expected to fulfill their tax-paying responsibilities in that country, then foreigners in our country can be expected to do the same thing," Woodard said.     In addition, as many as 61 pct of the 2.5 mln Americans who live abroad do not file tax returns, costing the government 2.3 billion dlrs a year, Woodard said.     The total tax gap -- the difference between taxes owed and actually paid to the government -- is about 90 billion dlrs.     Millions of dollars are lost because Americans fail to report foreign income and because U.S. businesses with foreign operations can underreport income, Woodard said.     The IRS will increase compliance by reassigning 100     examiners to international tax returns, a 25-pct increase, which should lead to more tax return audits.     The IRS will study entire industries to spot trends or practices by foreign-owned companies in their compliance with tax laws, Woodard said.     The IRS looked at the electronics industry first, but Woodard denied it was because of the trade dispute over semiconductors between the United States and Japan.     The agency next will turn its attention to the automobile, computer and motorcycle industries.     The IRS will also receive information on anyone who applies for a U.S. passport or permanent residence in the United States to help indentify those who do not file returns.  Reuter ;

A year ago WestLB had forecast average growth of just under three pct for 1986-1990.     The 1987 report said gross national product would only expand a real 1.7 pct this year -- below previous expectations -- because of weaker exports. Growth rates will pick up later, however, producing a 2.2 pct increase on average for the five-year period.  MORE ;

The Pentagon made the announcements yesterday and the State Department said U.S. Ambassador to Thailand William Brown had been called home to supervise a security review of the embassy, which is alleged to have been penetrated by Soviet KGB agents helped by Marine guards.     Brown is an ex-Marine who once was an economic officer at the Moscow mission.     Marine Cpl. Arnold Bracy, 21, was charged yesterday with espionage, conspiracy and failure to follow lawful orders in a case which U.S. officials have said involved sex with Soviet women. Sgt. Clayton Lonetree, whose arrest triggered the spy-sex scandal, has already been charged with espionage.     Pentagon spokesman Bob Sims told reporters a third Marine, Staff Sgt. Robert Stanley Stufflebeam, 24, who served in Moscow between 1985 and 1986 at the same time as Lonetree and Bracy, was being held on suspicion of lying to investigators about contacts with foreign nationals.     Stufflebeam, who was second in command of the embassy guard, is suspected of failure to report all contacts with foreigners and making false official statements in his debriefing when he left the embassy.

TEST; 2-APR-1987 07:32:48.44;JAPAN/U.S. WILL BE AT ODDS WHILE TRADE LOPSIDED;  Japan is doing all it can to solve its trade problems with the United States but the two nations will remain at odds as long as the trade account is lopsided in Japan's favour, a senior official said.     "So long as there is an external imbalance there will be trade friction and ...Harsh words between the two governments," the Foreign Ministry official told reporters.     Last year, Japan racked up a 51.5 billion dlr surplus with the United States and economists said they do not see it falling significantly any time soon.     Washington announced plans last week to slap up to 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods, raising the spectre of a trade war between the two countries.     "We take the current situation very seriously," said the official, who declined to be identified. "The basic stance of the Japanese government is to tackle the issues with all available resources."     The United States has accused Japan of reneging on an agreement that called on it to stop selling cut-price computer microchips in world markets and to try to import more American semiconductors. Tokyo has denied the charges.     The Foreign Ministry official refused to rule out Japanese retaliation if America went ahead with its threatened tariffs in the middle of this month. But he said that any response would be in accordance with international law and Japan's international obligations.     He added that both Japan and the United States must take account of the impact of their dispute on their own and the world economy.  REUTER ;
TEST; 3-APR-1987 06:01:38.48;RECENT SUGAR FALL SPARKS SOVIET, CHINESE BUYING;  The recent fall in world sugar prices, due to increased producer pricing sales and evidence of export availability, has encouraged renewed buying interest from China and the Soviet Union, London trade house E.D.And F. Man said.     Further purchases are expected by the Peoples Republic of China at the lower end of the recent price range, which should limit the downside movement, it said in its latest monthly market report.    "And it is believed that the Soviet Union will need to return to the market to take a further 250,000/350,000 tonnes for May/June shipment, Man added.     The Soviets purchased five cargoes of raws for April/May shipment towards the end of last month, which brings its total purchases to around 1.65 mln tonnes, Man said.     Production estimates for the Thai crop now exceed 2.3 mln tonnes and the final outturn appears set to reach around 2.5 mln tonnes. However, this upturn in the Thai crop is being countered by a reduction in China's production forecast to 5.3 mln tonnes from 5.5 mln estimated earlier.     Market participation by Cuba suggests that its crop could be close to last year's 7.3 mln tonnes. But even with similar production Man expects Cuban exports to be significantly down.     Cuba was reported to be carrying 1.3 mln tonnes of stocks in September 1985, of which some 440,000 tonnes were used to boost its 1985/86 exports to about 6.9 mln. But as it will not be able to draw on surplus stocks this year, Man estimates Cuba's export availabilty will be reduced to 6.4 to 6.5 mln tonnes.     However, Cuba is only one of a large number of exporters with reduced availability, Man said.     Since 1980 the total free market export supply has fallen to 18 mln from about 22 mln tonnes. But at the same time free market demand has also fallen by almost the same amount, which has left exporters chasing falling import requirements.     A fairly tight balance now appears to have emerged. But the difficult task of keeping production advances at bay still remains, as at least one more season of production deficit is needed to eliminate some of the remaining surplus stocks still overhanging the market, Man said.     The increasing cases of record production as a result of record yields and better husbandry have forced sugar producers to strive for greater efficiency.     As this increase in efficiency reduces the marginal cost of production, sugar exporters may become more responsive to prices and in particular to upward price movements, Man said.     Commenting on the current row between the EC Commission and sugar producers, Man said despite the recent improvement in the level of restitutions, they are still insufficient to fully compensate producers when exporting on the world market.     Unless there are further improvements, at least some sugar is expected to remain in intervention, it added.  REUTER ;
TEST; 3-APR-1987 09:05:40.57;STOLTENBERG SAYS PARIS ACCORD POLICY TO CONTINUE;  West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the currency agreement reached in Paris in February had been successful and would be continued.     Stoltenberg told journalists before he attends next week's International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington that: "The ... Strategy to stabilise currencies around current levels has proven its worth and will also determine future developments."     Stoltenberg declined to comment specifically on what he would consider to be an undervalued dollar but said a dollar around 1.80 marks created problems for West Germany's exports.     He said studies by international organisations had made it clear that especially in the U.S. And in Japan major efforts remained necessary to support adjustments in foreign trade balances via necessary corrections to economic policy.     "No-one would benefit if, after years of over-valuation, the U.S. Dollar fell into the other extreme, that is, strong under-valuation," he said.     Stoltenberg said West Germany had a keen interest in a swift agreement between the U.S. And Japan concerning the current trade dispute over semi-conductors.     Asked whether he believed the markets would test the Paris currency accord, Stoltenberg did not comment specifically but noted that much of what had been discussed in Paris had not been published.

TEST; 3-APR-1987 11:37:03.68;USDA CORRECTS TURKEY CREDIT ANNOUNCEMENT;  The U.S. Agriculture Department said an announcement by the department yesterday concerning 15.0 mln dlrs in additional credit guarantees for exports of U.S. commodities to Turkey contained two inaccuracies.     First, the USDA said its announcement should not have said that plywood was excluded from the additional three mln dlrs in GSM-102 credit guarantees for lumber.     The original announcement said the guarantees included three mln dlrs for lumber, except plywood.     Melvin Sims, USDA general sales manager, told Reuters he did not anticipate any plywood would be included in the sales, but that "it's possible it would be."     Plywood in the past has not been eligible for GSM-102 credit guarantees because it is considered by some to be a manufactured product. Members states of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have pledged not to offer concessional credits on manufactured products, Sims said.     However, the Reagan administration is considering whether to allow plywood sales to be covered by the credit guarantee program, Sims said.     Second, the USDA announcement said 6.0 mln dlrs of a previously announced 6.0-mln dlr line for tallow under GSM-102 was available for both public and private sector importers.     In fact, the line of credit guarantees for tallow is available only for public sector importers, Walter Stern, Foreign Agricultural Service Turkey analyst, said.  Reuter ;
TEST; 3-APR-1987 11:47:13.83;PLYWOOD CREDITS EYED BY REAGAN ADMINISTRATION;  The Reagan administration is debating whether to provide government credit guarantees for the export of plywood, a U.S. Agriculture Department official said.     As a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, the United States has agreed not to provide any concessional credits on the export of manufactured products.     However, USDA General Sales Manager Melvin Sims told Reuters the administration is considering allowing USDA to provide its first export credit guarantees for plywood on the grounds it is not a manufactured product.     Sims said it was clear that wood products such as furniture, tables and window frames would be considered manufactured goods and therefore ineligible for export credit guarantees. However, the case of plywood was less clear.     "As long as it's a basic material, we consider it still just a processed version of the basic agricultural commodity," Sims said in a telephone interview.     Earlier today, USDA said that plywood was eligible under an export credit guarantee offer for Turkey announced yesterday. In its original announcement yesterday, USDA had said the offer included three mln dlrs for the export of lumber, excluding plywood. However, Sims said he did not expect any plywood exports to be including under the lumber guarantee offer.  Reuter ;

But the dollar's downward potential was limited by persistent Bank of Japan intervention throughout the day.     Some dealers started to sell dollars on speculation that the Group of Seven meeting expected tomorrow in Washington is unlikely to produce any significant new measures to stabilize currencies, some dealers said.     The dollar closed at 145.25 yen against 145.85/90 in New York and 146.00 at the close here yesterday.     The dollar ended at 1.8205/15 marks against 1.8260/70 in New York.

The market is closely watching for a probable meeting between U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker and Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa later today ahead of the G-7 meeting, dealers said.

Japan is expected to explain to the U.S. The guidelines of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's economic package to stimulate domestic demand, a senior party official said.

The firm tone of the pound is expected to remain for the time being due to bullish sentiment, mainly on speculation the ruling Conservative Party would retain power in expected general elections, although the Bank of England may intervene in the market, some dealers said.     The Bank of Japan stepped into the market soon after the opening and continued to intervene in the market to buy dollars on a small-lot basis all day, dealers said.

TEST; 8-APR-1987 09:52:12.98;STOLTENBERG SEES MOVES TO STRENGTHEN PARIS ACCORD;  West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said today's meetings of major industrial countries would look at ways of strengthening the Paris accord on stabilizing foreign exchange rates.     Stoltenberg told journalists he saw no fundamental weakness of the February 22 agreement of the Group of Five countries and Canada to keep exchange rates near the then-current levels.     But he declined to say what measures would be discussed ahead of a communique of the Group of Seven ministers later today.     Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said the importance of the Paris agreement, also known as the Louvre accord, had been underestimated.     Stoltenberg said there is greater agreement now among major countries than six months ago, at the time of the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, marked by sharp discord between the United States and its major trading partners.     "There is no fundamental weakness of the Paris accord," he said. "We will be looking at ways of strengthening it, but I do not want to discuss that here.     Stoltenberg said the Louvre agreement was working despite a "slight firming" of the yen against the dollar.     And Poehl noted that the dollar/mark parity was unchanged since February 22 without the Bundesbank having had to sell marks to support the dollar.     "The Louvre agreement has been honored by the market," he said.     Poehl said West Germany had lived up to its side of the bargain in Paris by preparing the way for tax cuts to be accelerated as a way of stimulating growth.     Poehl said, however, that Japan had not yet fulfilled its pledges for economic stimulation.     "And we will have to see if the United States is able to do what they promised in Paris on reducing the budget deficit -- and get it through Congress," he added.

TEST; 8-APR-1987 13:47:22.39;CUBA TO STIMULATE ECONOMY DESPITE IMPORT CUTS;  Cuba will continue to develop its economy despite the need to cut imports from hard currency nations by half this year, President Fidel Castro said.     The Cuban economy is going through a difficult period due mainly to two years of drought, low sugar prices, a fall in the price of petroleum and the fall in the value of the dollar, Castro said in a published weekend speech delivered to a young communists union congress.     Castro said  cuba will continue to prospect for oil, build thermo-electric generating stations, a large petroleum refinery and a nuclear power plant in 1987.     He said work would also continue this year in developing the chemical and mining industries. Among the main projects in mining are two nickel processing plants built with Soviet and Comecon aid .

TEST; 8-APR-1987 17:29:49.36;DOME <DMP> PLAN MAY FORCE SALE OF ENCOR STAKE;  Dome Petroleum Ltd's proposal to restructure debt of more than 6.10 billion Canadian dlrs includes provisions that may force the company to sell its 42 pct stake in <Encor Energy Corp Inc>, Dome said in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.     Dome said in the filing that its debt plan proposes making payments under a five year income debenture to the lender whose debt is secured by Dome's Encor shares.     After the five years are up, "under certain circumstances the shares of Encor may be required to be disposed," the company said.     Dome has pledged its 42.5 mln Encor shares as security for part of its debt to <Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce>, estimated last year at 947 mln dlrs.     Analysts have said Commerce Bank was pressing Dome to sell the stock to pay down its debt.     Dome's Encor shares had a market value of 313 mln dlrs on March 17, 1987, the company's filing said.     As previously reported, Dome is seeking approval in principle for the debt restructuring plan. Dome said in the filing it proposed lenders sign a letter of understanding in early April, with implementation to be effective July 1, 1987.     Dome Petroleum reiterated in the SEC filing that its existence as a going concern is dependent on continuing the interim debt plan, due to expire on June 30, and winning agreement for its proposed restructuring plan.     "The company believes that the negotiation and implementation of the proposed debt restructuring plan is realistic and achievable," Dome said.     "However, the final outcome of the negotiations cannot be predicted at this time," it said.  Reuter ;

The Detroit Free Press quoted GM industrial relations vice-president Alfred Warren as saying "we've got about three to five years to either get our act together or get out of the business."     "People cannot believe we could stop building automobiles in the United States," he said, adding "I'm sure the electronics people felt the same way."     Warren, who will be GM's chief negotiator this summer in labor bargaining on a new contract covering 380,000 U.S. hourly workers, said there will be a greater loss of jobs if GM's share of the U.S. car market continues to decline.     And he added the United Automobile Workers union must resolve its concerns over job security with GM because its "jobs are at General Motors...not somewhere else."     Warren said GM may have been "foolish" in the last recession to agree to bring back laid-off UAW members to its parts-making operations because "today we would be better off had we not brought workers back."

TEST;17-APR-1987 12:34:25.61;U.S. COMMERCE TRADE REPORT OMITS FREIGHT COSTS;  The Commerce Department said on that insurance and freight costs for imported goods of 1.45 billion dlrs were included in the February trade deficit of 15.1 billion dlrs reported on Tuesday.     The department is required by law to wait 48 hours after the initial trade report to issue a second report on a "customs value" basis, which eliminates the freight and insurance charges from the cost of imports.     Private-sector economists emphasized that the Commerce Department was not revising down the deficit by 1.45 billion dlrs but simply presenting the figures on a different basis.     A report in the Washington Post caused a stir in the foreign exchanges today because it gave the impression, dealers said, that the underlying trade deficit for February had been revised downward.     The Commerce department would like to have the law changed to permit it to report both sets of figures simultaneously.     "My feeling is the second one is a better report but there's legislation that requires us to delay it two days," said Robert Ortner, Commerce undersecretary for economic affairs.     "But this has been going on for a long time and no one pays any attention to the second figure."     The 15.1 billion dlr February trade deficit compared with a revised January deficit of 12.3 billion dlrs.     The law requiring a 48-hour delay in publishing the monthly trade figure excluding freight and insurance was passed in 1979.     Reportedly the feeling was the first figure, which includes customs, freight and insurance, allowed a better comparison with other countries that reported their trade balances on the same basis.     The second figure, which would always be lower by deducting freight and insurance, presents the deficit in a more favorable light for the Reagan administration.     Ortner said he would like to see the law changed to eliminate the 48-hour delay in reporting the two figures.     "We're considering it," he said, "It's one of those dinosaur laws and I think it's time has come."     The second figure, which would always be lower by deducting freight and insurance, presents the deficit in a more favorable light for the Reagan administration.     Ortner said he would like to see the law changed to eliminate the 48-hour delay in reporting the two figures.

TEST;17-APR-1987 15:37:10.81;FORMER BALDWIN-UNITED CHIEF SETTLES SEC CHARGE;  The former chief executive officer of Baldwin-United Corp, now known as PHLCorp <PHX>, agreed to settle charges stemming from misleading financial statements the company is accused of making before it collapsed in 1983.     Under the settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, former Baldwin-United President Morley Thompson agreed to an order issued by the U.S. District Court in Cincinnati, Ohio, barring him from committing further securities law violations.     Thompson did not admit or deny the charges.     Although Thompson was the last of several defendants to settle charges brought by the SEC on September 26, 1985 in connection with the Baldwin-United case, the agency said it is continuing to investigate other matters related to the company and may bring charges against other people.     Baldwin-United, a Cincinnati-based diversified financial services holding company, went bankrupt in September 1983. It changed its name last November to PHLCorp.     The SEC said Thompson violated reporting and anti-fraud provisions of federal securities laws in late 1982 by issuing misleading press releases.     Baldwin-United, which has already settled SEC charges brought against it, made "false statements concerning the financing for two corporate acquisitions," the SEC said.     The statements indicated that the company had available cash for the takeovers while it was actually facing a "serious cash flow crisis," it said.     The company was also accused of filing false and misleading financial statements with the SEC.   Reuter ;

The move was seen as a major blow to Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, the leading advocate of the five pct tax.     Some analysts predicted Nakasone might be forced to step down just after the June summit of leaders from major industrial democracies, well before his one-year term is due to expire at the end of October.     The ruling party though was anxious to pass the budget before Nakasone leaves next week for the U.S. so that he could tell Washington the Japanese government was doing its utmost to boost the sagging economy and imports.
